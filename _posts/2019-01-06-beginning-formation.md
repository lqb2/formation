1.

i am love: stardust, gravity, matter  
i, matter

i am the love of the universe.

i know i am because when i say it, i shake  
my skin tingles  
my heart pounds  
i want to cover my mouth  
but i remember that i am  
and so i do not

because when i remember that i am  
power beyond my limits arrives  
it was always here  
always  
but i forgot  
forget  

and so my work
is to remember

2.

and you?  
when you say it?  
maybe your hands will also shake  
or  
maybe these words  
are not rooted in you  
as they are in me

but if you are here  
facing yourself (the Universe)  
then there are words rooted in you that will make you shake  
where are they?  
ah, is that their light we see  
coming through the seams?  
what are they?  
let us open them

we/all will know when you have  
the ocean has a funny way of finding us

3.

to integrate is to bring the pieces together

after traveling, a trip, a journey  
integration is   
bringing from the mountaintop  
what we can use in the valley  

and so we work  
in the valley  
hoping to return to the highest points  
with more than we brought last time  

healing is partnership  
with ourselves  
with each other  
with the Universe  

i am  
you are  
we are  

here 

let you/me/us  
remember
