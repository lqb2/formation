today i finished a 1.5 day consulting gig. on the way out, one of the people in the group <!-- tony parchment --> said two things to me worth noting. 

during the closing circle he tony parchment said "i'm so thoroughly impressed by how you present yourself at your age. how old did you say you are? 27? 29? when i was your age, i wasn't nearly as thoughtful or well-put-together as you are. wow!"

on the way out of drinks, he says "thanks for facilitating for us. you're an old, old soul."
