tonight i got in a (union) taxi to get home from the airport. within a few words of conversation, the driver (pema (sp?)) looked back at me and said, "hmmm! you seem like you're very present-minded right now. your smile, your eyes, you seem like an enlightened soul... am i right or is that a stretch?"

floored.

he proceeded to tell me he was tibetan, buddhist (but not in the religious sense) and that i seemed like a person who could tap into bliss. 

mind. blown.
