today begins black history/futures month. excited for that. 

i want to learn about libations (singular? plural?) so i'm starting to do that as the ritual practice before i shuffle my tarot deck. 

i read [this blog post](https://globalfaithministriesofchiism.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/libations-itu-mmai-7/) about the practice of libations but i want more. if you know anything, would you please share or point me to another resource?

finally, in honor of black history/futures month, i think i want to commit to writing flash fiction related to me and my lineage(s) every day. maybe it's one story with many entries. maybe they'll all be separate. who knows. either way, time to get writing.
