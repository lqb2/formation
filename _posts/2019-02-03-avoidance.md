so! 

here we are at my first moment of truth. this is me being vulnerable not knowing where this is  going. 

yesterday, i pulled the moon (reversed) and the 8 of swords.

whether you know tarot or not, here are some intepretation thoughts: 

the moon, in one way, is about working with the imagination and dreams (sometimes pleasant, sometimes terrifying). working with these things, where our shadows are, can generate fear because the things there are unknown. the moon reversed says that one is avoiding looking at the darkness. and then the 8 of swords is about blockage that isn't actually forcefully holding the captive. the woman behind the swords isn't actually locked in by then. she could walk around them if she wanted... but she has not yet taken that step. 

today, i pulled the world, also reversed. 

the world is about the supreme, divine union of unconscious, consciousness, and super-conscious, then blending of secular and spiritual, the merging of earth and heaven. and the union results in a dance. the truth revealed there to me is that the universe IS about movement. 

when reversed, the message is stagnation. 

today and yesterday all point to two things:

* i am avoiding my shadow work
* the way i avoid it is simple: by not taking *any* steps

it's become clear to me in the last week **why** being busy is so detrimental to my life's work: it allows me to avoid being with myself. and since i am the only vessel through which particular medicine can flow, if i don't know how to be with myself, how will i know how to work with my magic? 

as i say that it sounds extreme, but i guess what i really mean is that this is a moment to do some deep work and i need time and space to sit with it to do it. which means i'm at another moment of needing to clear some space. 

i've been through this many times before and i have strong muscles around saying no... but it seems they need to get even stronger. 

i feel good about my ability to do that. 

what i don't feel good about how to start taking steps. 

my ask to you: when you know where you're headed but you are stuck, what do you do to get yourself unstuck? how do you take a step forward?
