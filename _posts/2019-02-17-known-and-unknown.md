this write up is more brief than the weight it carries, but i've been trying to write it for three days and not doing it because i'm overblowing the time it needs in my mind. working on moving through that by sharing here in short: 

last week i committed to a bringing a new spiritual practice into my regular ritual flows. i guess it's actually just a modification, but i'm going to shift my usual saturday 1h sitting meditation into a Spirit walk. ideally it'll be through the arnold arboretum, but wherever i can find some nature will do. 

today, i went on my first one. 

it was prompted because i was going to be hosting full moon circle later and the last time i held one, i did 1h in the arb and it felt like what was needed. 

so today i walked in my usual gate and felt drawn to a path i've often looked at but had never taken before. as i walked, i reveled in getting to know the new territory. and soon enough, i found myself near the shrub and vine collect where the bonsai collection is (learning: the bonsai collection is only available outdoors april - nov)! 

as i stumbled onto that familar place i was reminded that i love that sensation! the feel of finding my way to a place i know but from a totally new angle. i love love love when this happens in cities! often when i'm new to a city i'll see lots of it for starters and then i'll settle into areas near where i live and get to know those areas really well. then, as i start to expand and explore again, i'll find myself back to places i visited early on but didn't realize how they connected to my usual pathways. it's the "omg THAT'S where this road goes" moment. i literally love those moments...

and then it dawned on me: that's what deep internal work looks and feels like. the work of self-exploration and also integration is just the process of exploring the unknown paths between known areas! 

phew. maybe that was a lot more intense in my head or for me than it is for you, but it feels like a major breakthrough for me! :D
