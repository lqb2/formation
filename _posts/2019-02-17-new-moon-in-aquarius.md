# Aries

_basic personality & ego_

**Aligning myself with the people, places, and actions that bring me closer to my dreams is my main priority. There are a million distractions, doubts, and fears to get caught up in daily.** There are a million ways in which I have been taught to devalue my vision, to denigrate it, to convince myself that I am not the answer to it as much as it is to me. **But my destiny is to be met on a two-way street.**

**It needs me to make room for it every day. Aligning myself with what I most want to manifest is something I have to consciously do. Repeatedly. Daily.** Enthusiastically if possible. Honestly, always. 

If I am being truthful, **when unchecked I will tend to grasp for what might make my ego momentarily happy**. A place. A thing. A person. An idea of success, love, or acceptance. But **unless achieved in a way that deepens my connection to myself, my loves, my life, and my world, nothing will satisfy my soul’s desire to do good work with good people.**

**I want to know what it means to feel aligned with my life’s purpose** so deeply that I never refuse the challenges, victories and defeats along the way. **I don’t waste my time chasing fool’s gold.** I want the glimmer to be inner, first and foremost.

# Aquarius Rising 

_how others experience me_

**I am renewed each time I allow myself to move thoroughly through a process. Each time I allow myself to reach the bottom, to ground, to land. Bouncing back is not necessarily the end-game, but unless I get to the bottom of things, I’ll never be able to.**

**Each time I allow myself to look up.** Stretch up. Rise up towards the light. **I am refusing to stay in the shadows of my past.** **Each time I allow myself the luxury of cycling through my process without feeling rushed or overly attached to any one part of it, my energy is regenerated.** 

**I am renewed each time I remember that life is not something I figure out, but something I find a way to be in partnership with.** Each time I try to pin my possibilities down into a definite answer, I am deadening the energy of everything else that is trying to flow towards me. **With this new moon I release the need to know how, what, where, or with whom things will work out** and instead I focus on the direction I feel pulled towards in this moment. **Every time I gather my energy, recalling it from the past, I am reinvesting in myself, this moment, and all the possibility it possesses.**

# Virgo

_moon: inner self & deepest emotions_

**I find every avenue possible to love the labor.** As much as I take advantage of rest. As much as I honor my downtime. As much as I revel in my free-time, to the best of my ability I find things to adore about my work. 

If I want bounty to come from my efforts, I have to make peace with the practice that goes into creating it. **The secret to my success is loving the process**, not just the performance. 

I leave room for opportunity. **I remember not to get too rigid in how I think my work or efforts will be received, what they will amount to, or where they will go.** **I work in ways that help to regenerate my creative energy.** I work in ways that keep me focus on the reasons that I do what I do. **To the best of my ability, I clear out what leaves me feeling cluttered, muddled, or confused about my direction.** _**I am here to work towards what will bring the most joy and healing to the most people, places, and causes.**_
