story. 

the other day i was sitting in the barbershop texting kendra. we were talking about scheduling a phone call and i was being all sorts of weird about it. i realized this in hindsight. 

she asked me for some dates that worked during a particular week. i responded with a message about being out of town for three days that week. then the below conversation ensued...

as i worked through my own stuff, kendra saw that last message from me and then said something that literally rocked my world.

i teared up right then and there in the barbershop. 

i didn't realize how tightly i hold onto my fear of disappointing other people!!! 

kendra and i texted some more and she said (paraphrased) "given what you said, i could feel that you needed to hear that from me. don't ever worry about disappointing me, and especially not when you're taking space to do what you need to do for yourself."

ho. lee. shit. i am leveled. 

gonna be sitting with this for some days/weeks/months. how many situations in my life are shaped by this belief of mine? 

i will shift it in time, but for now, just noticing and reflecting... wow.
