i started reading the wounded healer a few days ago when it arrived. it is a killer of a book. i'll ask my assistant to process all the highlights from it when he's back from his magical vacation with his booface, but until there, i'll just share a few that really struck me:

> “Mysticism and revolution are two aspects of the same attempt to bring about radical change. Mystics cannot prevent themselves from becoming social critics, since in self-reflection they will discover the roots of a sick society. Similarly, revolutionaries cannot avoid facing their own human condition, since in the midst of their struggle for a new world they will find that they are also fighting their own reactionary fears and false ambitions.”

> “When we wonder why the language of tradition Christianity has lost its liberation power for nuclear man, we have to realize that most Christian preaching is still based on the presupposition that man sees himself as meaningfully integrated with a history in which God came to us in the past, is living under us in the present, and will come to liberate us in the future. But when man's historical consciousness is broken, the whole Christian message seems like a lecture about the great pioneers to a boy on an acid trip.” 

(and the next paragraph of the above quote)

> But how can we avoid this danger? I think by no other way than to enter ourselves first of all into the center of our existence and become familiar with the complexities of our inner lives. As soon as we feel at home in our own house, discover the dark corners as well as the light spots, the closed doors as well as the drafty roos, our confusion will evaporate, our anxiety will diminish, and we will become capable of creative work.

i love that one because it's my new definition and purpose for doing shadow work (which i've been talking to some of yall about). i'm adding these words to words already in my mind/heart that two of yall have shared with me. <3

> But just as bread given without love can bring war instead of peace, professionalism without compassion will turn forgiveness into a gimmick, and the kingdon to come into a blindfold.
