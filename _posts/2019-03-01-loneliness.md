i'm collecting articles and resources on loneliness for two friends. my thinking: loneliness IS part of the human experience. by looking at it and becoming friends with it and its unavoidability, we tap into the reality that we are deeply unalone because we are part of the universe. but i'm looking for ways to help share that with friends who don't see that yet or that way.
