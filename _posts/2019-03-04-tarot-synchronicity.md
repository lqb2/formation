last week, on feb 27 i pulled the sun. on feb 28, i pulled the king of swords reversed. on march 1, i pulled them both. well, the sun fell out while i was shuffling and i pulled the king of swords reversed. 

clearly this is a message i need to hear: the sun's light turned inward to my own truth. i have been doing lots of intention setting and prep for my march 10 medicine journey work and i think this is a signal for that. so excited!
