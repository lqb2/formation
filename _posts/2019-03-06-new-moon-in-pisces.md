# Aries

_basic personality & ego_

Memories, and the emotions attached to them bring information that I never refuse. **Timing is everything and any part of my past that is being recovered right now is worth investigating.**  Even briefly. **I know not to hang on to what is moving through me, but I also know not to resist the current.**

I am both the container for my experience and the witness of how it pours forth. 

**Like water overflowing, I allow my imagination to play with the possibilities of what it looks like to live into, through, and beyond the stories of my life.** To survive is to defy. 

**What I allow to define me is my choice, my point of power, and my right to change when and where I need to. With this new moon I am reminded to take note of what I am calling myself, how I am referring to myself, and what that infers to myself. I am here for my liberation, and _anything that needs to be released on the way to my personal freedom must be given back to its owner_.**

**Within the incubators that house my creative energy I give myself permission to regenerate. Here I reclaim myself, rename myself if need be, and remember that I am always becoming**, undefined by what has happened to me or hasn’t happened for me.   

# Aquarius Rising 

_how others experience me_

**What is mine to work with has always been and will always be.  I need not fight it, push it, or feel like someone else can take it from me. My resources may take their own time to develop, but they deserve every second they need to take shape. I trust that when the tide ebbs it will flow again. I trust that the projects that wash up on shore are gifts for me to develop. I know that anything that gets lost at sea need not concern me.**

**I am here to work on what is in front of me.** No fantasy. Just the reality of working towards my dreams with every solid, grounded,  effort I can make. **_I no longer place my talent, time, and resources into containers too leaky to hold them._** Ideas without action aren’t failures, they are foolish to focus on. If I want it, I work towards it. Inwardly and outwardly. 

**I’m healing my relationship to my financial life no matter the damage, drain, or despair that I’ve experienced because of it. I am not at the whim of my livelihood, but the curator in relationship with it and all it might be able to do.**

# Virgo

_moon: inner self & deepest emotions_

**I am made stronger by every moment of vulnerability I have allowed myself.** Even when I’m met with less warmth than I’d hoped from others, I’m still fortified by my own efforts. **Being honest in front of others takes courage.** **I am willing to look like a human who makes both mistakes and as many attempts to get it right as it requires. I am willing to be humbled by all that I still need to learn.** I am willing to be misunderstood on the way to being known. 

I’m in no rush to be right.

**My relationships require me to learn how to be open to my own experience when I’d rather shut down, shut you out, or shut the door completely. _When I am able to hang out in the moments of wanting to do so, without actually doing so, I know that growth is occurring._** I know that change is possible. I know that from this place all the information I need becomes available to me. **With much change on the horizon, I know that developing the skills to sit with what’s uncertain and uncomfortable is more than useful, it’s the most reliable compass I’ll ever have contact with.**

# Cancer

chiron description from [cafe astrology](https://cafeastrology.com/chiron.html). shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.

> Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.
>  
> Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.".

**I honor the editing process that I am in. Like weeding an overgrown garden, I remove what is unhelpful in order to bring out the beauty naturally present.**

**I work with this new moon to clear what clutters my path.** Doubts that have no sense need to be dumped. Fears that have no foundation need to be exposed as the frauds that they are.  **Shame that no longer serves a purpose needs to be shown the door. This clearing is mine to do. It can’t be shopped out, left for another, or put off.**

**This helps me take responsibility for the direction I am heading in, but it also helps me feel empowered in the process of doing so. The more I own my desire to head in the direction of my dreams, the less likely I am to resent the work necessary to get there.** 

**With this new moon I claim the path that I am on**, all that it asks of me, and all that it asks me to give up, miss out on, or forgo for it. I am crystal clear about the price and that the payoff is to merely be in this process with it. 

**I use this Mercury retrograde to review my strategies, maps, and ways of getting from point A to B, making sure that they leave me open to get all the way to Z.**
