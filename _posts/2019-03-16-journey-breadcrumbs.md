so first thing to share: [this post about breadcrumbs on my blog](http://lqb2.co/blog///2019/03/13/breadcrumbs/) is 100% a journey experience. that is the headline takeaway from this journey: only breadcrumbs can be left behind. 

that leads to three actions for me: 

1. find the breadcrumbs of my ancestors
2. make and eat this lifetime here and now (since i can't leave it behind)
3. leave breadcrumbs for my descendants (bio and/or chosen)

some other thoughts about the process: 

* what is so magical to me about the combination of these particular medicines (let's call one 'heart' and the other 'forest') is that they make my worldviews and limiting beliefs LITERAL and then, once i can see them, i usually get the chance to break through them. this happens in regular life too, but so much more slowly. it happens in journeyspace like every few minutes (if not faster). 
    * and in some ways, this is exhausting. i know the medicines have physical explanations as to why we feel tired or sore after moving them through our systems, but this rapid worldview shifting feels like the psychic facet. 
* so much can happen while the medicines are in me **and** what happens with those insights is continually expanded afterwards. after sleeping and waking up for integration, the discussion and thoughts from others who were in the space can flip, rotate, explode, or widen what i had previously thought the insight was. and as i have begun to integrate some of the thoughts and insights into my life this past week, i talk to people about them and they take on even more meaning/layers.
* i wrote a TON during the early chunk of the journey when the medicine was coming on. i have never had the desire to write anything before in ceremony so i'm not sure what changed this time. more forest medicine? the small setting (1 guide, 1 co-journeymate)? the context? who knows...


anyway, here's a rundown of the breadcrumbs i left myself (know that this is probably 1/3 or less of what happened). things in brackets are descriptions of context. the breadcrumbs are in present tense (they're only slightly edited version of what i actually wrote): 

### thought flow 1: 

* [i started the journey laying down with my frog in my left hand, his stick in my right hand, one of my sweetgrass baskets on my belly and a polaroid of me holding my godson, asa shortly after his birth.] i don't have visuals! of queer, christian fatherhood. does this mean i'm supposed to be a model of that? not committing to that now but noticing...
* oh wait, maybe i do have models of that... they're called monks. i just don't want that model. i want more. 
* but on that tip... what does it look like to give birth to a soul? (note to self: talk to luana about this)
    * look into baptism as a practice (also eroc baptized me on cortes island)
* i've been getting a lot of signals about my throat chakra lately but in this moment i think what's coming up for me is that the blockage i need to clear isn't mine... it's my dad's! maybe *he* is my closest model of queer christian fatherhood. holy shit. 
* actually, so maybe the modeling that's needed is queer, christian, black fatherhood?
    * need to have some gentle/hard convos with my dad about all those "friends" of his we used to visit
    * also i think part of my own history of sexual abuse happened while we were visiting "friends" or family and i spent lots of time in my male "cousins" bedrooms playing video games and... why are there gaps in my memory here? this is either just forgetting or sexual trauma. gotta go there someday but not today. 

### abbreviated thought flow 2:
