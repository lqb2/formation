so. one thing: i think i am releasing the commitment to adding more to that previous journey post. it's causing me more weight and angst than i think is necessary. i'll add more to it if i feel it but i'm not committed to it anymore. i am learning, practicing how to release old commitments. 

here's another thought, though, from that same journey. it mostly came through conversation with some of yall. 

a narrative i have around the medicine work i've done so far is that these particular medicines connect my brain to more of itself. so in that state, my brain is making connections across wider "gaps" and faster than in regular state. 

and as the medicines work their way through my system, the links close back down and the connection-making slows and narrows again. 

but every time, it doesn't slow down to what i perceived the pace was before. and i had the thought during one of the days immediately following the journey "what if the rate of making connections between things is permanently increased because of this work?" 

and then a chat with danielle essentially verified that and i was like :O

that is both terrifying and awesome. 

why? well, here's another story from the experience. i mentioned it briefly and early in that other post, but here's a little more.

one thing my guide said to us was that the medicine brings you the lessons you need to learn. it meets you right where you are. too fucking true. 

so this was my first journey where i expected to have visuals. and as the medicine was working its way in, i was looking all around the room for them. at candles, at faces, at lights, etc. 

nothing. 

after our guide came over and checked in on me, i noticed my heart racing. i had some curiosity about that and thought "well, since i'm not seeing anything, at least i can tune into my body like i do when i meditate." and i thought that that usually happens easier when my eyes are closed. so i close my eyes to tune in more and then...

BAM! visuals. shapes floating around and rainbows and shit. 

of course, right? 

the lesson: stop looking outside of yourself for the interesting stuff. it's all happening inside you.

so that's the process that these particular medicines put me through. they make a way i'm viewing the world VERY literal and then once i see it, i can topple it and move on to the next one. 

this happens like 50 times over the course of the evening. which is wild!

and so, to my earlier thought, if that starts happening faster and faster over time in my life outside of journey space... well, damn. lol.
