march 29 thru april 6 i was in corbett, oregon, for my css job. we had our big annual 5-day training called [the advanced training](https://www.storybasedstrategy.org/the-advanced-training) and i was on the staff planning and support team. it was overall an amazing time. here are some photos [of the training and staff team](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvvjga9n6xu/), [of one of the evenings](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv6tZEPHOun/), and [of one of the training days](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv1_2BmhIcU/). 

two things i want to share here though because of the "spiritual" nature of them. 

first, my (new) friend, jess st. louis, found out that a friend was murdered by the police on one of the days of the training. devastating. 

[pause]

i just want to note that i really really did and do feel the weight of that experience. what i'm about to say next is journaling about my side of the experience, but i hope it doesn't come off as trivializing the experience of a murder...

[pausing again and taking a deep breath]

what i want to say about that situation was that i followed my intuition lots and it was good. two trainers and i went to jess while she was holding the initial news and in tears. it was in the morning, but eventually, the trainers had to go back to their small groups. it turned out to be **really** great that i wasn't on the training team. i could stay behind and hold space for jess while the other trainers went back to their responsibilities. 

i just sat with jess and we breathed and she did a somatic grounding practice (she's a student of generative somatics) and just held each other's gaze and it was good. i shared a few thoughts (literally don't remember what i said... #Spiritwastalking) and gave a few ideas of how she should move forward with the next few hours. before leaving, she said she wanted to check-in with me after her time alone to have me see if she was actually ready to go back to her training group or if she needed more time. i said i could definitely do that. then she went to walk by the water (we were on the columbia river). 

i took my [comboschini](https://www.orthodoxpath.org/spiritual-life/comboschini-prayer-rope-part-1/) and walked the labyrinth to do my own grounding. how awesome was it that there was a labyrinth onsite?! 

in a magical unveiling of some sacred geometry, i found that if i said my mantra ("i am the love of the universe") per bead, it ended up being me getting to the center of the maze. and then i did the same on the way out. so i got 200 mantras in and by the time i got back inside, jess was looking for me! unreal timing. 

she and i went to go sit on a bench near a hummingbird feeder and overlooking the water. we had a good chat and i felt that she needed a little more time solo before going back. she thought my assessment was totally right and took the time before heading back in to her group. 

fast forward to the last day of the retreat: on the way out, jess says to me "not only was it helpful, it was an honor to be held and supported by you as i handled that news. thank you."

:O

ok, will have to share the second thought another time... i could just write SO much. interesting...
