[back to part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/general/2019/04/12/interesting-developments-at-the-AT/)

part 2! the second thought is about the 2nd half of the training. i'm going to keep it short so that i'm not late for my call in 3 mins:

i had a few agenda sections during the week, mostly 5 or fewer minutes long. each of them was to talk about my role as network engagement coordinator and to discuss network weaving vs networking. each time i got up in front of the room, the reception was pretty good! 

on wednesday, one of the co-directors asked me if i would be willing to take on and lead with an activity a big chunk of the friday agenda. i waffled but said yes a few hours later.

then on thursday, she asked if i would be willing to _close the entire gathering!_ i was like... you mean instead of you or the other co-director or our other colleague who has been to SIX of these trainings? she said "yup. it seems like people are craving a bit more spirituality. that seems like what you're bringing and me and [other co-director] aren't really feeling like we can bring that.... so think about it. get back to me." 

i thought about it and was definitely hesitant for all the usual reasons...

* why me?
* what if i mess it up?
* i'm the only man present on staff at the training... that feels weird

and the biggest questions of all: what if i actually do a good job? what if this was the way it was meant to happen? 

after sleeping on it, i said yes. 

thankfully, the closing activity was already decided (it was one that was from a previuos year); i just had to lead it. but i did it and i _think_ it was good. there was definitely an awkward moment or two, but it was definitely definitely progress. 

a few other notes from the week:

* my nervousness of speaking in front of groups has diminished substantially this past year
* writing out my talking points is a good practice for me. and even if i don't look at them as i'm speaking, the process of distilling my whole shpeel into bulles really helps me remember them when i'm up
* when i speak about things i actually know about, it's easy to talk and even ramble. when i'm less familiar or less comfy, things get weird, heh. 

ok! that's all for now! thanks for listening.
