so last weekend, my friend, cameron, organized a bunch of my other friends to pitch in and get me a new tarot it. 

it's funny because i have actually been (a) thinking/feeling that it was time for me to get a new deck and (b) eyeing the reprint of the dustiionyx deck for a bit and was sad i saw that the deck cost $150. 

it felt AMAZING to see the deck when i opened the package on saturday night when everyone was around. 

i did some bonding with it on sunday morning and was really digging it.

and then monday came around and the resistance began to sink in: 

"woah, this deck is way too much for me! i'm in over my head... it's like... so magical and so Black and so expansive and i'm not ready! there's so much different: the elements, the court cards, the imagery..."

and then, Spirit was like... nah. 

one day last week, i saw luana at juicygreens and she said, totally unprompted, something like "yup. this deck is totally your level." 

:O

and then i saw my friend, jess, and she said something like "dang, this deck seems just right for you." 

:O :O

so. i guess it really is my deck. yikes. lol.
