it's been a while! 

i have currently committed to too much client work and so my writing about my formation work has been halted for the last month (it's literally been one month since i last wrote) but the movement has DEFINITELY not halted. here are a few bullet points but there's so much depth here: 

* i finished reading decolonizing wealth. i am deeply in the process of shifting my relationship to wealth. it's pretty wild. turns out, money is all about flow. let it flow out and let it flow in. right now, i'm feeling really excited to have flows that are allowing me to pay off my loans faster than expected. 
* i just came back from a silent meditation retreat ([waking up fabulous](https://www.garrisoninstitute.org/event/lgbtiq-retreat-waking-up-fabulous-taking-refuge-care-in-ourselves-the-practice-and-each-other/)) with danielle. she supported me (in many ways) to go and it was literally amazing. lots happened and opened up but two insights feels important right now:
    - turns out, i can take 30 minute naps without an alarm. i left tiredness behind at the retreat and i'm stepping into liberation through naps. this is not a joke. naps are like the opposite of slavery. 
    - this came from convo with danielle: silent meditation is like medicine work but much slower and (therefore?) much more integrated. "it's all ceremony."
* we shifted in the formation project from "inner" work to "outer work." after some frustration in the transition, i'm learning that inner work and outer work are linked in a much closer way than i expected. like... my inner work practices literally can be transformed into my outer work. more on that to share later (i.e. the line between inner and outer is a (sometimes helpful) fiction)...
* one of my outer practices is about using gardening to connect with my neighbors. since setting up the garden two weeks ago and setting that intention, i've had conversations with 5 new neighbors! it's like magic. 

ok. that's all for now.
