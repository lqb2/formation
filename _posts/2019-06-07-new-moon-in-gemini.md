# Aries

_basic personality & ego_

**The way to build a base is brick by brick.** Laying down my defensiveness in exchange for depth. **Digging into the past in order to understand the dynamic of the present moment.** Smoothing out the wrinkles of unacknowledged feelings in order to let the energy flow.

**The way to cure loneliness is one interaction at a time.** So I can absorb the wisdom delivered by my loved ones. So I can experience the depth of friendships in my life. So I can remember that my mind will tell me all manner of stories about how isolated I am, how unique my problems, and how precious my sorrows. **But being with others that live honestly reminds me that my struggle is the human one, and I need not go it alone.** **I know that if I rush through every interaction, every hurt feeling, every miscommunication, I can’t ever get to the healing. I won’t dwell in the pain of my past, but I won’t refuse its messages when they visit me in the present.**  

# Aquarius Rising 

_how others experience me_

**Inspiration is unruly.** Wild. Untamable. Living beyond our timelines and confined calendars. **I cannot summon it when it is convenient for me.** I cannot complain when it doesn’t oblige me.

Inspiration arrives without warning and leaves without apology.

**Left grateful for its gateway, I take any amount I am given and place it where I won’t forget about it. I build homes for it to visit. Gardens for it to plant itself in for a time. Gateways for it to saunter through when it wants to.**

**But I don’t rely on it in order to do my work. Instead I go to the canvas, drawing board, desk, and dancefloor with my dedication to being there.** I know that showing up for the creative process and listening to whatever it’s got for me that day is more than half the battle. **I know that embracing my wildness means loving what I’ve been told is unacceptable. I know my shame and I am not put off by it. I know my fears and I am not stopped by them. I know what it means to fit in, and I am not here for any kind of conformity that divorces me from my precious, potent, life-giving, IDGAF-about-anything-but-the-truth, energy.**

# Virgo

_moon: inner self & deepest emotions_

My career is a cure for my past mistakes, mishaps, and misdirected energy. I pour my desire for anything I’ve yet to experience into the container of my public roles. **I am here to give all that I have to the world. I am here to empty myself of all excess love, creative energy, and life lessons. Anything I have been given isn’t mine to keep, but it is my responsibility to share.**

Even when the world refuses to see me as a gift, I know otherwise. My sources are rock solid. I trust my intuition above the naysayers with nothing but negativity to offer. I know how resilient the energy that runs through me is, so I will trust it over the systems my situation finds me in.

**I get myself to the wells that refill me.** The sounding boards that hear me out. The courts that let me bounce my ideas around, **giving me all sides of the story so that I can make the best decisions** and go in the directions that set my soul alight.

chiron description from [cafe astrology](https://cafeastrology.com/chiron.html). shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.

> Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.
>  
> Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.".

**All of the work that no one sees shows up in the finished product.** All the worrying, all the fussing, all the lullabies I sing to the creative projects that I want to bring into the world are palpable in the end result.

My work is to stay patient with the process. My work is to keep my awareness on what needs me most. **My work is to not feel sorry for myself if I have to miss out on a moment in the world.**

**There will be more.**

I attune myself to the bigger picture. I keep my focus on my long term goals. **I know that anything that gives me temporary relief should be used, but only sparingly if it detracts too much from staying on the path of productive self-discovery.** I know that there is no such thing as personal perfection. Everytime I get caught in the net of such a deceptive foe, I feel my life force getting tangled, bound up, wrapped around energy channels that need to flow freely. **I know that my best effort, done consistently, is the way to work. I know anyone holding me to another standard probably does the same with themselves, and that isn’t about me.** *I leave what isn’t mine behind.*
