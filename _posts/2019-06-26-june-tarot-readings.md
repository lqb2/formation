so i'm at the june 2019 css staff retreat and i have done two tarot readings, one yesterday and one today. 

yesteday's reading was totally fine and i think it was useful for the recipient. 

just now though i did a reading that felt on fire. but, unsurprisingly, i think it had everything to do with the recipient. i also gave a presentation earlier today (each staff person gives a 15 min short presentation each retreat about a topic of their choosing that blurs the line between the personal and professional) on my formation work and how it relates to my job at the org. one of the 10 slides was about my tarot practice and i think that might have also had something to do with the recipient being receptive to it. 

also she said she has been avoiding her clairvoyant abilities for her whole life. so there's that too lol. 

anyway, it seemed like the reading unlocked lots for her and i felt a new level of access to my intuitive depth. and even in the 20 minutes after the reading, she texted me a breakthrough and real integration she's had. it seems real. 

super pumped about it! more readings coming up later this week for other staff members (at least two). we'll see how they go...
