notes

* libations are one of the most common elements
can be simple or one day 

liquid (alcohol or water or other) poured on the earth to honor the relationships we have with each others, the earth, animals. it brings them in and manifests our intentions.

connecting to fellow humans and fellow spirits. 

we recognize our resposibility to those future generations. 

shamanism is practices and a worldview

each tradition has a different definition of what spirits are

tungus term shamam means 'one who is raised'

for djaloki
* spirits are invisible beings
* shamanism is spirit intelligence. the goal is to make relationships with invisible beings work for us and the spirits

african voodoo comes from benin/togo

"everything fits in shamanism."

magic is a tricky word because people who do illusions in english are called magicians. but there is magic beyond illusions, tho illusions may also be magic. 

magic: accessing the invisible thru visible means or accessing the visible thorugh invisible means. 

symbolism,analogies, metaphors, synchronicities - these are things that translate from spirits into language that humans can understand

alchemy has a principle of sublimation
* things that go direction from solid to gas. sage, incense, tobacco. these things represent the spiritualization of matter. 
* * the sage, when it's here in leaf form it's here. but once it's gas, it's everywhere.

why do shamanic journey
* increase awareness and relationship
* it's fun
* gives me more health
