saturday july 13 was the launch of the 2 year evolutionary relationships cohort. i'm feeling honored to be a part of it. i am going to start a little notebook (or maybe continue an existing journey notebook... gah, i think i have my journey notes in like three different places. my bullet journals and two small notebooks for journeys but one is for drumming journeys and the other is for plant medicine journeys... why did i do that?)

my intentions going in were _to be grounded and to let go._

anyway, the crew is full of powerful-ass people and i'm so excited for it. it's a journey to advance our collective consciousness so the real work/progress will be measured in the collective capacity but here are some individual insights that came through this time: 

* s.g.: "last time i saw you as a spider... this time, you're a crow."
* speaking my vision repeatedly is how i get less contraction around it. — in convo with a.n.
* sometimes i do healing without even realizing i'm doing it. 
* "you are the perfect thing! you are exactly what i need right now." — o.t. 
* "i think you would be a perfect e.d. for [the org you work at]." — dcc
* o.t. might be my post-patriarchy futures collaborator
* i now have three concrete memories to explore and do some healing work around concerning childhood sexual trauma. maybe in future sessions with this group or maybe that is separate work? 

**integration thoughts**

s.t. gave us the prompt: what ignites your heart? thoughts i had:

* knowing that the needs of my community are what turn on my magic. 
* knowing that i can be the perfect thing for someone, that i can be exactly what someone needs. 
* remembering that what got me to where i am isn't going to get to me to where i'm going. 

and some integration thoughts from other people...

* catalysts reduce the energy necessary for a reaction to occur. i/we are learning how to be catalysts. and there's real biochemistry/mother earth to learn from here. — m.d.
* wherever there is a gap in the me, it is filled by the we." d.v. 
* if you don't clear the brush, it just makes for a bigger fire later. — ecc

i also wanted to write up what my body is doing/did:

* while on this particular heart medicine, i always wreck the inside left of my jaw. next time, proactively ask for jaw support.
* afterwards, my body is definitely tired. 
* so far, using this medicine i have yet to purge.
* i do notice a tightness or pressure in my stomach and lower belly before, during, and after. 
* after i also have to frequently remind myself to breathe deeply. i catch myself breathing shallowly often.
* my temples are always sore 1-2, maybe 3 afterwards. lots of jaw movement happens during so that makes sense as an aftereffect

ok i think that's it. thanks for traveling with me!
