we're moving into the final phase of formation: it was originally called 'beyond' (following phase 1: inner, and phase 2: outer). now it's called 'inner-outer' which is profounding confusing. but &shrug; 

one of the first prompts we're being called to is this: 

``` Make time over the coming days to take stock of where you have been. Revisit your materials from the Discernment Period. What stands out now from the Healing Action Plan? What did you learn from reflecting on formation? From your conversations with your people? What did you say Yes to in January, and how has that played out? Start to notice threads running through your experience since then. Start to listen for an area youâ€™re called toward in your life.
```

as i've started to do even a tiny bit of that reflection, so much is opening up! thoughts i've had so far: 

**what have i learned on reflection on formation so far?**

* WOW! when i think about current me compared to oct 2018 me, so much has changed. _and_ in that funny non-dual way, so much is the same. but when i think about what i'm doing with my time, many things are different. 
* i'm so much better now at spending time solo. it's clear now, beause of practice, why that time matters so much. it's not selfish... it's energizing to me and, by the transitive property, energizing for my community. 
* i am holding spiritual circles now like... all over the place. 
* the line between spiritual and non-spiritual circle is much blurrier than it was before. 


**what have i learned from conversations with my people?**

* having things i say said back to me is a huge way that i learn. luana did this first with the poem i wrote in response to one of the first prompts we got in the program. and danielle has done it to me most recently and in a way that totally blew my mind. 

**what i haven't done but still want to**

* heal wounds related to blackness (emotional emancipation group didn't happen)
* transform relationship with dad (maybe do decolonizing christianity book club)
* explore gullah geechee ancestry
* explore other african ancestry and spiritual traditions (mali: dogon, root work)
*
