i think i had forgotten this but i'm super into labyrinths. there have been labyrinths at the site of the advanced training i was at back in april with css, there were two at the location of the united for a fair economy training of trainers location in north andover, there were two (though i only found one) at the garrison institute for waking up fabulous, and there are two where i am now at the site of our css staff retreat (in san anselmo on a satellite campus of the sf theological seminary). [insert photos] there's a sci-fi story in here somewhere about the connections between labyrinths...

second note: i walked one of them yesterday with two co-workers and i walked the second one today for some grounding after a really hard moment on retreat. there's probably more to say on that but that's not what i wanted to say here... when i got to the center of the labyrinth, i found that people had left two stones/crystals, a heart pendant, and a bundle of (now dry) flowers. i wanted to leave something but i didn't want to leave the stone or crystal i was carrying. i decided to leave nothing and was feeling kind of guilty about it. but on my way out i started picking up trash and then had the thought: "oh sometimes the gift one brings can be the removal of something." and upon further reflection, i think that's what a lot of healing work (especially when embedded in community) is.

anyway, that's all for now. gotta go finish some work before bed!
