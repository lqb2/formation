so something someone <!-- owen thomas --> said to me while during evolutionary relationships 1 was "you are the perfect thing! you are exactly what i need right now!" 

on monday july 22, a different friend <!-- margie dillenburg --> emailed me and said 'You are perfect and right on time.'

ok ok i get it. 

edit: 30 july 2019 â€” and now dcc has added "you are the perfect human."
