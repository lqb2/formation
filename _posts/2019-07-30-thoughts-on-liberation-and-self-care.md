a few quick quotes and thoughts i'm having while reading _my grandmother's hands_ by resmaa menakem. 

> a calm, settled body is the foundation for health, for healing, for helping others, and for changing the world. 

> a settled body can help other bodies to settle themselves. an unsettled body can push other bodies to be unsettled. (briefer version: a settled body can settle other bodies. an unsettled body can unsettle other bodies.)

because of these two things, i'm now thinking:

* caring for myself is not an option. it is foundational. i cannot heal myself or others without knowing how to settle (and activate) my body. i cannot do what is needed without a settled body. 
* liberation is not "over there" or "coming up soon." it is in moments and experiences. liberation, like life, is in the body (ht [dcc](http://infinitegrowth.rocks/blog/2019/3/2/life-is-in-the-body)!)
* harriet tubman said "my people are free." she knew it and saw it and worked to make it so. i know of people in chains and personally know people in prisons who are free. freedom is joy without fear. therefore, contrary to lots of dominant rhetoric, i do not believe "none of us are free until all of us are free." i believe that when one surpasses fear of death, you can be free while staring down the barrel of a gun. i believe this is how harriet and ancestors who drowned themselves instead of being enslaved and jesus and buddha and people with kids who quit their jobs without knowing what's next are all free in the same way. 
    * soooooooo this isn't clean language yet but i believe that "those of us who are free love freedom so much that we will risk it to help others experience it." and like harriet, that might mean slipping back into the territory of the unfree and leading others to freedom. this is both literal and physical and also a metaphor.
