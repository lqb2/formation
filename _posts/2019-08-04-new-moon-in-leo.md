# Aries

_basic personality & ego_

To the best of my ability, I make room for joy. I defend my right to it. I guard it against being overtaken with the many distractions of the world. I know that being able to be playful is a privilege – one that fear, insecurity, and sorrow swallow when given the chance. There have been many times, a million moments, where I couldn’t access what felt good. When I’ve had to spend all of my energy surviving. When I was worn out by just trying to get through the day. Whatever distance I have from pain, I promise to pursue what brings me healing so that I have more space for hope. 

One moment of pleasure can rewire my entire system, so I treat it as my most sacred of medicines. 

With this new moon, I plant the seeds for future joy to spring forth. I clear what clutters my path to it. I make no exceptions for those that say one thing and do another. I have no patience for anyone that takes what they want from me but offers little to nothing in return. I make sure that I don’t follow those that lead with only their needs in mind. With this new moon, I recommit to my growth through the most enjoyable avenues available. With this new moon, I remember that my prosperity is made more bountiful when shared with the world around me.  

# Aquarius Rising 

_how others experience me_

Every moment of intimacy I experience burns away a layer of what prevents me from feeling lovable. Any lies about my worthiness that I have picked up, made up, or bought into can be dispelled by a sincere act of kindness. Disrupted by direct transmission of care. Derailed by an act of generosity towards me.  

I make sure to receive them. 

This new moon highlights the relationships in my life that are abundant in their ability to know that love is its own reward. There is nothing to get from each other, just experiences to give and receive. There is nothing to demand of one another when boundaries are respected and beauty is honored. There is nothing to push anyone else towards when I am as firm as I need to be with what is important to me. 

I have no fear that those that share what I find sacred will find me. 

With this new moon, I remember the power of enjoying the company I keep. I surround myself with those that want to place mutual pleasure side by side with respect and integrity. 

# Virgo

_moon: inner self & deepest emotions_

I break for joy. I stop when it’s been too long since my body felt loved, replenished, and rested. I pause for all things that help me live my best life. 

For all that I give, offer, and make myself available to, I am allowed to receive, accept, and let myself be. With this new moon, I take some of my best advice. I remember all of the love I have put on others and I put the same on myself. I recall the energy I have spent on building my outer life and reinvest it in doing some inner maintenance. I know how important it is to reconnect with myself through the potent activity of not giving AF while not doing AFing thing. 

I am worthy of a reset. I am worth resting for. 

With this new moon, I remember my inherent value. Separate from my production schedule. Separate from my bank account. Separate from what I can do for others. With this new moon, I focus on valuing my free-time, my natural state of being, and all my rituals for restoration and renewal.

chiron description from [cafe astrology](https://cafeastrology.com/chiron.html). shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.

> Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.
>  
> Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.".

I magnetize the materials I need to build my dreams. I cleanse my mind of toxic ideas about amassing wealth for my gain alone. I clear my heart of the misconceptions that I need to cling to, hold on to, or hoard attention and societal recognition. 

I know that the more I share, the more I have. 

I make space for what is honestly abundant in my life. Cheap renditions of affluence are no match for the power of generosity. I know that I have been gifted with a bank of goodwill and I plan on spending every cent of it before I leave this earth. I know that I have been given every tool I could ever need and I plan on putting them to the best use. I know that if I don’t focus on innovating how I do my work, I won’t feel alive when I do it. In order to experience abundance, I have to know what things in life can be risked abundantly. My pride, my ego, and any feelings of superiority I may harbor can all be risked, disrupted, and interrupted for a greater wealth to illuminate my life. 

I willingly dismantle any false beliefs that tell me I need to be greedy in order to be wealthy.
