a few weeks ago, luana (w/ me on assist) opened a meeting with some ritual work. lu invited me in to lead libations while she rang her bell. it happened and felt good, but the real thing i wanted to write about is this: kathy. 

two things happened for her. 

first, she shared with us that during the libations sections where i was pouring for future ancestors, the baby kicked. and then kicked during every other mention of ancestors but didn't kick during any other sections! #shook

second, she shared that the part of the libations where i called in visions and dreams of the future had a supercharged impact later. that night she had a dream where a friend of hers (a friend who died of cancer two months ago) wanted her to tell his widow that she should "not be afraid to let her light shine a little brighter." that next morning, that friend popped up in kathy's IG feed and kathy relayed the message and it was received really well. 



obviously this was lu and me (and all the ancestors and elements and universe) together but still pretty wild for me to be a part of something like that. phew.
