so this past sunday was my [clearness committee meeting](http://www.couragerenewal.org/clearnesscommittee). the prep work was three stages/bridges:

* bridge 1: review my healing action plan. what have i achieved? what is still in progress? what haven't i accomplished (yet)? 
* bridge 2: review all my spiritual reports. what am i noticing? 
* bridge 3: discernment meeting (using the quaker clearness committee practice) based on the following questions:

    - What is the area of my life I am drawn toward greater connection to the sacred
    - Who am I being called to be in this area
    - What gets in the way
    - What steps might I take to move through obstacles into a new way of being

over the past few weeks, i've been digging in (not as much as i wanted to, but still a good bit) and really seeing that i've done quite a lot. in order to get to sharing about the committee meeting, i'll skip some of those insights for now, but there's some good stuff in there. 

when i got down to answering the above questions, here's what i came up with: 


**What is the area of my life I am drawn toward greater connection to the sacred**

* menâ€™s healing work, with a focus on queer men of color but not exclusively
* being grounded


**Who am I being called to be in this area**
* a healer and a facilitator
* in flow

**What gets in the way**

* Needing money 
* Lack of focus

**What steps might I take to move through obstacles into a new way of being**

* Moving towards a living situation and financial setup that allow me to do more healing work without needing to ask people for money

as i came to the end of filling in the questions, all sorts of doubts arose. "maybe i'm making up all these answers just to finish the assignments. maybe there's something deeper, something beneath all these answers, something i should really be digging in towards."

<!-- then a few things happened: 

1. eroc gave me a call a few hours before the meeting and gave me lots of really beautiful feedback about what he's seen in me since this process began. it affirmed lots of the answers i'd written up 
2. luana called and left a magical, affirming voicemail.  -->

so when the time for my committee meeting came, i brought in all those answers and the doubts, too. 

i won't recount the whole call, but essentially the following insights are my takeaways:

* instead of holding my doubts as "is this made up vs is this true/not made up," what if i held the frame that _everything is made up because reality is based on our perception_. in that case, if the answers i "made up" are that i am being called to men's healing work... then that's as real as anything else. 
* what i'm being called to in this moment may not be the same thing i feel called towards later. i can make that decision when it arises (but it's actually not possible to make that choice before the choice point arrives).
* (eroc also said this) one of the authentic/integral parts of my healing work for others is that it is almost always rooted in what i need for myself. this is part of how i stay balanced in my "giving" and "receiving." this is a critical balance to maintain.
* two things in particular get me most excited about men's (healing) work: 
    - men hugging each other (like for real holding each other)
    - men who are closeted being able to come further and further into themselves and out of shame/fear. 
* i love working in/with groups, though 1:1 is where my eyes light up
* my aries energy, the energy of the initiator is very very real.

SO! that's that for now. thanks, again, yall for supporting me and i'm excited to see what the final 2 months of this program hold. it looks like my group's last official call is oct 27. what a ride it's been. and when it ends, i know it'll still just be a new beginning...
