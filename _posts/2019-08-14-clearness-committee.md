Clearness Committee Questions
What is the area of my life I am drawn toward greater connection to the sacred
menâ€™s healing work, with a focus on queer men of color but certainly not exclusive
Being grounded
Who am I being called to be in this area
A Healer and a facilitator
flow
What gets in the way
Needing money 
Lack of focus
What steps might I take to move through obstacles into a new way of being
Moving towards a living situation and financial setup that allow me to do more healing work without needing to ask people for money
