# Aries

_basic personality & ego_

With this new moon, I tap into my determination. It is always there as a resource for me to draw upon, but now I put it front and center as a practice. What I do on repeat plays the tune I create my life to. My rituals create worlds of meaning or disappointment. Mayhem or joyful chaos. Much ado about nothing or a lot of that special something.

I routinely sharpen what is in my toolshed. By flipping, reversing, and reconstructing the outdated structures I have been handed to work within, I make a triumph out of what was too tired to be of use. 

I make sure that my instruments are cutting edge. 

I’m not here to create a career in honor of mediocrity. With this new moon, I honor my unique way of using what I have in my professional grasp, when and where I can. Doing so requires effort as much as rest. It requires planning as much as it does dreaming. It requires me to develop my talents as much as it requires me to play without needing to produce. I focus on staying on track as much as I allow myself pathways to get lost down. 

# Aquarius Rising 

_how others experience me_

There is no succeeding if I’m unwilling to work with the entirety of my experience. Particles of my past regularly intertwine with the events of the moment, but being able to parse out one from the other is what makes deconstructing demons possible. Pretending I am above my burdens only forces me to remove myself from life. Beauty doesn’t always showcase the process it takes to get there, but I’m here for the whole of my experience.  

It’s my job to dissect what derails me. It’s my job to know the difference between what is dangerous and what feels threatening but will ultimately leave me thriving. It’s my job to find the people and the practices that help me live a life with less self-condemnation, doubt, and devaluing of my gifts. 

With this new moon, I sort through what is a phantom of my past and what is the promise of a noteworthy future. 

It’s never fun to face a fear, but it’s the only way to ground and grow. It’s the only way to truly get to know who I am. It’s the only way to get to the gold that lays in wait underneath it. 

# Virgo

_moon: inner self & deepest emotions_

I’d rather live my life in pursuit of joy, justice, and connection than spend my precious energy convincing others that I’m right. I know that what I’m right about will reveal itself. I don’t have to push truth on anyone. 

When I’m present, the need to prove anything vanishes.

I trust that everything I do in earnest is revealed eventually. I focus on directing my energy towards what works right now. I focus on channeling my creativity into projects that help me regenerate. I focus on my rebirth this Virgo Season.

I trust that what I need will find its way to me, what is mine will never refuse me, and what is happening at this moment is needed and necessary. I trust that the relationship dynamics in my life are helping me hone in on a couple of key lessons I need to learn now. I trust in love’s medicine. Its healing process uncovers my fears, my fortunes, and my everything in-between. I am here for the whole unveiling.



# Cancer

chiron description from [cafe astrology](https://cafeastrology.com/chiron.html). shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.

> Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.
>  
> Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.".

I pay attention to what my intuition is telling me. I thank it for the messages it sends. I track its ability to always guide me to where I need to go next. I’m all for making plans, but I’ll break them if and when my gut demands I do. 

With this new moon, I make a note of the books that magically fall off my shelves, the teachers that I accidentally stumble into, and the emails that come at exactly the right moment. I know that each time I acknowledge the synchronicities of my life, I reclaim a little bit of my power. Being overly invested in only the physical realm dulls my senses and intuitive powers. When I forget my connection to the living world, the most intense self-criticism my mind can cook up has a chance to take hold of my spirit.  

With this new moon, I thoroughly investigate all the murmurs in my mind that suggest I am losing, lost, or failing at life. There are too many systems that win when I entertain self-doubt. There are too many other possibilities and potentials at play that I can and will tap into instead. There will be moments when I forget this, but they will pale in comparison to the moments when I recall my power. With the new moon, I commit this to memory.
