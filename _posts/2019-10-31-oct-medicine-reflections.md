ok. gonna try this another way. i'm REALLY frustrated that my 20 minute recording didn't record. like unbelievably so. i have been feeling so much guilt/weight to circle back around to yall and every day that i haven't has just felt bad. and then when i finally figure out a way that i can check back in with the ~12 of you who i said i would, it doesn't work! my time has been hella hectic since mid-oct and it won't slow down much until late december, though there are some slower spots in nov and dec. i have multiple weeks where i'm traveling 6 out of 7 days in a week and that means (a) i don't check hardly any new communications (b) old communications lag and (c) i focused on trying to keep my paid work afloat so my clients or job doesn't fire me. ANYWAYS enough guilt-based caveats. i'm gonna start writing in 5 minute chunks just to keep this update moving and here goes the first (well i'm already 3 minutes in ... yikes)

### overview

it was great. it was different than every other experience i've heard of who does this medicine. (sidenote: i heard that everyone's experience is unique with this medicine and that nothing you've heard about it will be your experience. that resonated and also just felt like a universally true statement, haha). the retreat, which i had assumed was heavily focused on the medicine ceremony, was only actually 1/3 (at most) focused on the medicine ceremonies. the bigger picture of the retreat was about developing collective consciousness and practicing listening to it. and even the medicine ceremonies were about the collective (as opposed to the individual). that said, i did have some powerful insights some through in the personal/individual lane, but they were all very background to the collective learnings. powerful stuff and i can definitely imagine doing a more standard, individually focused ceremony with this same maestro again in the future.

[begin writing on airplane to SFO]

a huge amount of work happened before i even left boston for the drive to the weekend. i did a shitton of exploration and dancing with fear. i read a lot, observed myself a lot, and had lots of insights. over the weeks leading up to the experience, i started writing down everything i was afraid of. i realized at a certain point that all the fear was actually just a few, recurrent things. 

after i noticed that, i used the "5 whys" as a framework for exploring each fear. i'd sit with the iceberg tip of each fear and then, over the course of some days, the next layer down of the iceberg would reveal itself. and several weeks in, i'd worked through several of these fear icebergs and that was SO helpful. 

for example: (like almost everyone) i found myself grappling with the fear of purging. so i asked myself: *why am i so afraid of vomiting?* that lead to the insight that it's actually that i'm afraid of being out of control. so then i asked: *why am i so afraid of being out of control?* and the insight that came was that it's actually fear about being out of control of my body. so then i asked *why am i so afraid of being out of control of my body?* and the next insight was that i'm afraid that if i'm out of control of my body, no one else will know how to take care of it. question: *why are you afraid that others won't be able to take care of your body?* insight: this teacher has sat in the amazon for ten years with this medicine. not only that, but this group of people has been sitting with this medicine together for seven years. what makes you think they, collectively, wouldn't be able to figure out how to take care of your body? question: *so what's beneath my thought that other folks couldn't care for my body if i was out of control of it?"* insight: it's actually that you don't trust others to take care of you when you're in need. 

and all that lead to a final conclusion: i need to get clear about my concerns for my body, figure out how to express them to the holders of the space, and then trust and let go. 

all that happened leading up to the experience and that was just ONE of these fear icebergs. there were several others, but i'll save those so i can keep moving on this shareback.

### the two ceremony nights

the first night, we all took a lighter than usual dose. and instead of the typical ceremony where the shaman sings icaros to everyone and then 1on1 to individual people, he would start us off with a song and then we'd take turns leading a short verse and then we'd all sing the long chorus before the next person jumped in to lead. 

coming on had a few indicators that i want to keep note of for the future: 

* nausea. i tried to lean towards purging but it wasn't coming so i stopped trying (though after doing all that work, i felt almost excited to try)
* some light visuals. zebra-esque color patterning and some swirling, but nothing too intense or specific
* a surreal experience of time slipping. like, we'd sang a song and i was clear that people to my left and right weren't singing anymore but i swore i could still hear the song being sung... like my mind was bringing the past into the present
* some dark figures appearing in my eyes-open line of sight. at one point i felt like the people to my right and left were standing up but i was sure they weren't. at another point, i felt like there were pillars of darkness coming from behind my head down in front of my face... sort of like if i had taken my dreads loose and let them hang down over my face. but i checked several times and they were definitely behind my head

then i felt sure i had "settled in" to the medicine definitely being active in me. honestly, the four hours passed MUCH MUCH faster than i anticipated. it all felt lovely in a very surprising way. i was practicing the mantra that i'd been gifted that monday evening before by tawna and had been writing on my hands since: "deep breaths, small steps."

i just continued to take deep breaths and know that each second passing is/was a small step forward into the unknown nature of the experience. 

we sang 3 or 4 or 5 more songs in the same style. only one person purged and they purged a LOT, every time we all collectively sang, in fact. there was a fascinating story from them the next day about why they think they'd purged at those moments, but that's not my story to tell. 

eventually, the shaman said it felt like the ceremony was closing and everyone agreed so we came to a close, relit candles (did i mention the room was in total darkness after everyone had taken the medicine?) and had a closing conversation before some folks started to trickle out to get food and sleep.

### insights

as many of you know who have experienced medicine work like this, there are insights that come through during the space and then they evolve/land as time passes outside of the space. i like the framing of calling that "integration." so here are some insights that came through live along with some of how they've each landed in my waking life. as i look back at them, in some ways they're not particularly new or profound... (there is nothing new under the sun) but what's profound about them is how embodied they are now for me:


* for a time, i kept playing this eye game where i was looking up at the skylight in the yurt and crossing my eyes to make the opening appear like two openings. the insight there is that **it really IS about how you look at things that determines what you see**. if i cross my eyes, my brain fully processes the one opening as two (and notably, two eyes that were then looking back at me). and if i relaxed my eyes, i only saw one. the role of literal vision itself is critical in determining how and what i see in the world around me. not only that, but (a) it's more effect to see multiple than to see the oneness (once you learn that) and (b) i don't have to do that much work to switch from one lane to another. it's still real effort, but it's less than it could be. 
*  sometimes when individuals joined in to sing, their voices weren't very strong. for some of the voices, they felt so weak that it made me deeply sad. i longed for their voices to be full and sonorous. i vowed to, the next day, propose that we do some collective singing to strengthen people's access to their voices. the next day, talking with one of the other participants, i learned that the medicine often hinders access to your voice. so the fact that i had full access to my voice was a rarity. and the fact that i almost offered an intervention that had nothing to do with reality was stunning. the learning: it's very possible to prescribe a solution to the WRONG problem if my analysis is wrong. **the insight: the best way to proceed in life is to listen with compassion and offer a solution or idea if asked or prompted**. in a way, this makes life *so* much easier to live. it makes space for a lot more being and dwindles the need for so much doing.
* as soon as we sat down, even before we took the medicine, i noticed i had to pee. but as soon as the maestro said that it's the best if we stay inside the ceremony space, i started to resist going to pee. i had the sensation of having to pee for the whole time. it ebbed and flowed and i worked deeply with one of the pieces of advice given by one of the medicine people: "when given sensation that feels unpleasant, ask for the experience to be transformed." eventually, i felt like i couldn't hold it anymore so i got up, put my jacket on, got my shoes on and asked my teacher for support getting out to the bathroom. i took the step (a big step for me) of, when he asked if i would be ok on my own responding that i wanted support (even though i knew deep down that i probably could have made it on my own). and as soon as he said yes, the maestro said that it was time for the ceremony to come to a close. ARGHASLDJFALSDKJF!!! i went back to sit down and then we had another 30+ minutes of closing before i could actually get up to go pee. my fear of being seen as someone who had to get up and leave the ceremony space kept me from getting my needs met. **the insight: fear of being fully seen, in sometimes surprising ways, prevents me from getting all my needs met.** – the cool thing was that i applied the lesson the next day in the middle of the sweat lodge and it felt like a huge breakthrough! now, tbc, i have no problem with letting ppl know i have to pee, in general. but the insight about the relationship between being seen and getting my full needs met was worth the experience.
* i totally totally psyched myself up/out for this experience. hour after hour, it became clear that thigns weren't going to be nearly as bad as i had made them out to be. now, on one hand, there's part of me that is grateful for my capacity to imagine many bad scenarios. it often means that when things go better than expected, i get wonderful feelings of relief and joy, instead of disappointment that things were worse than anticipated. that said, i am beginning to wonder about the amount of energy i spend doing that negative scenario planning and what else it might be used for if i let go of that imagining. (sidenote: one thing i read leading up to the retreat was that fear is only possible when you hold on to the illusion of control. fear comes when you worry about the outcome of something, which is linked to ideas of how that thing should go. when you release the belief that you can control outcomes, all there is to do is push, let go, and be curious.)

### conclusion

i've been writing this for about an hour so i'm going to wind this down. i think i'm going to be excited to have this level of detail later but right now i need to go do some work and get back to people with things i owe them.

i feel excited to have learned that fear can be moved through with deep breaths and presence. i love that my capacity to see the oneness in all things has taken a huge leap. i love these mantras that i'll work with in the future:

* push and let go
* let go and be curious
* listen with compassion, offer when asked
* life is a deep, resounding yes
* deep breaths, small steps

thanks for reading, friends.
