This commitment to my transformation is in support of my own movement towards liberation which, in turn and simultaneously is a necessary driver and element of liberation for our species (and beyond). In order to authentically use my gift / responsibility (supporting transformation), I must have the experience of my own transformation.\n\nPractice\nI will remind myself of my commitment by reading it aloud weekly, ideally during Sabbath. \nI will document my process weekly (maybe as a way to break my Sabbath) by writing and taking photos to share with my small group as well as my formation team. \nI will work with tarot daily. \nI will engage in journey work with plant medicine. \nI will meditate daily for 20+ minutes and have at least one 60 minute session per week.\n\nSupport and Inspiration\nI know that this will not be easy. I will remember to return to my commitment when I struggle or want to back out of this work. I will preemptively ask my elder to check in on me every two weeks. I will make sure that my formation small group and team knows my telltale signs of struggle and avoidance: poor time-management, lack of high-quality sleep, and under-communication about what is happening. When I feel overwhelmed, I will scale back to my minimum viable ritual: meditation.\n\nTo What End\nI make this commitment with my whole heart, knowing it may involve unforeseen challenges and disruption to the life I have known. It is worth doing because the gift, the medicine I have is useless unless it is shared. I have seen previous iterations of impact when I am doing my work in the world and now it is time to level up. Why now? The increasingly chaotic world we live in will require everything we have if our species is going to survive. I recognize and accept that the survival our species is not a necessity; species go extinct all the time. ‘Everything we have’ includes what I have and I am ready to step even farther into what that is so that I can play my part in this beautiful, universal love song of life and death.\n",

        "content": "source: https://chaninicholas.com/2019-horoscope/\n\nAries\n\nbasic personality &amp; ego\n\nAs Saturn, Pluto, the south node and three eclipses activate your 10th house of career, 2019 continues to up the anti in all your public and professional roles. You are being asked to build your resume with what you want to be known for. Consider what it means to take responsibility for doing more of whatever makes you feel boss in the best of ways. Keep developing the structures that are sturdy, and roomy, enough for the transformations you are undertaking. Change is a constant in every aspect of life, but 2019 asks you to let go of what doesn’t work for you in your professional sphere. Like muscle memory, every time you refuse to compare yourself to someone else, or some false “age-appropriate” goal, the more familiar you are accessing and working with your creative energy.\n\nWith the first of three eclipses in your 10th house of public and professional roles on January 5th, the beginning of the year is the perfect time to dedicate your energy to identifying, and then committing to outgrow, the fears you have of failure and success. Work with this eclipse to remove your hesitations and encourage yourself to take a leap of faith in your ability to show up and figure out a way forward. **Stay focused on the carefully selected professional goals you most wish to accomplish, and let go of the rest. Parsing your professional life down to its core, essential components is key to your success at the moment. **\n\nTwo weeks later, on January 20th, the total lunar eclipse in Leo activates your 5th house of creative self-expression. This eclipse highlights the healing and work that you have accomplished in this area of your life over the past two years. Creative projects get an important boost of attention and applause.\n\nThe north node and this summer’s total solar eclipse increase your appetite for the opposite; a cozy home and connections that feel familial, safe, and nourishing. 2019 asks for balance. Releasing what doesn’t work for you professionally is actually part of what helps you feel more at home. The less you have to fake it to make it, the more energy you’ll have to settle in and show up as yourself.\n\nFrom November 2018 through to December 2019, Jupiter expands your opportunity for travel, teaching, researching, and having a wild love-affair with information that inspires you. Watch for books to fall from shelves, long-term plans to roll out with greater ease, and travel pamphlets that catch your eye. It’s not that you want to (or can) take up every adventure on its offer; it’s about remembering that you are never too old, too stuck, or too far gone to begin again.\n\nAs Uranus finishes up its transit through your sign (not to return for another 84 years), the first couple of months of 2019 (January to March) mark the end of a very long adventure in personal rebellion. The planet of upheaval and breakthroughs has spent the last 7 years making sure life is anything but predictable. The changes you have made over these years hopefully liberated you from any false notion of needing to fit in or follow a trajectory not made for you. As Uranus (re)enters your 2nd house of assets, resources, and income in March, it continues to awaken you to innovate ways of doing business. Because it stays here until 2026, this is a long process, but one that will continue to help you liberate any outdated notions of how to make a buck or be defined by one.\n\n[need to finish highlighting aquarius and virgo]\n\nAquarius Rising\n\nhow others experience me\n\nThe first eclipse on 2019 (and the two that follow it in July and December) makes a strong imprint upon you. A large chunk of this year’s astrology happens in a part of your chart that deals with the work you do behind the scenes. Much of your glory is secret, but not to be underestimated in its importance.\n\nYour healing is the boss you want to work for. And make proud.\n\nAs your internal operating systems get a reboot, you are awakened to the absolute necessity of working with the more subtle aspects of your life. Inner imbalances become glaringly obvious, knocking your outer life off course. Energetic bills that you have put off come looking for payment. Efforts that you make to understand your psyche has major payoffs. Whatever rituals help you to stay psychically attuned, aligned, and clear need to be practiced with great rigor and reverence for their power. This work is not about receiving outside accolades, although it eventually brings you a tremendous amount. This work is about clearing out everything that has gotten in the way of you living honestly with yourself. As you do, more and more falls into place.\n\nAlignment with, is greater than aggressively pushing towards, your goals.\n\nThe second eclipse of 2019 occurs on January 20th, and is a total lunar eclipse and the last of its kind for a while. Over the past two years these eclipses have been activating your 7th house of committed partnerships. Lessons have come through those that you have risked joining forces with in romance or business. What you have learned about yourself in the process can’t be quantified, but it is clear that the learning has been priceless. Looking back, what have you accomplished, learned, or healed that could have only been done given the commitments you were working within?\n\n2019’s third eclipse comes in July. It encourages you to nurture your most important work projects. Whether you are trying something new or finding new ways to put more heart and soul into your already existing professional pursuits, do so with great emotional tenderness and tenacity. Your projects need to know you care about them, so too do the people you are co-creating them with.\n\nFrom November 2018 through to December 2019, Jupiter gifts you with an abundance of blessings that flow to you through community. Your friends, collaborators, and co-conspirators are able to lift your spirits, open doors, and help to carry your dreams to their next destination. Return the favor. Your soul yearns to give and receive generosity.\n\nAs Uranus finishes up its transit through your 3rd house of communications until March of 2019, it puts the finishing touches on the 7 year journey you have had together here. Through it, you have learned to speak the truth no matter the mayhem it may cause. Next, Uranus moves into your 4th house of family and foundation. Here until 2026, Uranus aims to revolutionize the ways in which you relate to your past and present family formation. Work on liberating yourself from norms that refuse your individuality for the sake of a false family harmony.\n\nVirgo\n\nmoon: inner self &amp; deepest emotions\n\nJanuary 5th is home to the first of a series of eclipses that activate your 5th house of creative energy, projects, and progeny. With its arrival you are asked to clarify your commitments to all you are bringing into form. If you want it, what are you willing to give to it and give up for it?\n\nSince eclipses will be occurring in this area of your chart for the next year and a half (July and December of 2019 and July of 2020), the first of its kind doesn’t necessarily demand an answer to this question. It’s more of an introduction to a process that you are in, setting the tone for your learning process. Meditate on what you wish to create but haven’t been able to due to fear of failure, success, or mediocrity. There is nothing average about making a sincere effort. There is only courage and a willingness to work through the awkward phases of learning how to self-express. Don’t worry about getting what you create right, just worry about letting your small fears stand in the way of big things.\n\nThe second eclipse of the year occurs on January 20th. It is a super moon, total lunar eclipse that lights up your 12th house of behind the scenes projects, unconscious habits and patterns. It  is the last in a series of eclipses in this part of your chart and it highlights the incredible healing that you have done over the past couple of years. What you have lost, and what you have had to let go of, may have been tremendous but what you have learned about yourself will last your lifetime.\n\nThis summer’s total solar eclipse amplifies the communal care you are in need of giving and receiving. With an increase of energy here, your friends, groups, and collectives you are a part of are all places of important exchanges. Party with connection as your intention and see what projects, insights, and opportunities form between you and others.\n\nFrom November 2018 through to December 2019, Jupiter is busy getting your house in order. With this expansive influence, your ideas of home and family grow, but so too might the members of it. Who are you welcoming? What are they teaching you? Notice what past patterns, feelings of abandonment, and fears of rejection are starting to soften, and maybe even heal.\n\nUranus finishes up its transit through your 8th house of collaborative efforts and enters your 9th house of long-term plans. Come March (and staying until 2026), Uranus influences your ideas about your place in the world, asking you to think more broadly about your future. More options open up to you as old paths close down before you can reach them. This shift in course is common with this transit. You’ll most likely end up studying, teaching, or traveling to places you had no idea you’d want to over the next 7 years, something that is made much more enjoyable when we are open to the possibilities rather than being married to an outcome.\n",

We must realize that this axe’ is always present, but when we consciously call it into our presence we have the opportunity to bless ourselves and others. If we play with it we can do great harm to ourselves and everyone in the room. If the leader of the ritual is not focused and consciously calls this energy into a room that is not ready it is like having a energy surge in your house, a fuse can be blown. But  instead of the lights going out in the house (which they can), the metaphoric lights in some of the participants lives go out (unbalanced events can begin to happen).\n\n\nso now i’ve shifted my daily question from “what do i need to know today?” to “ancestors, what do i need to know today?” it’s a seemingly tiny shift, but my pulls yesterday and today already feel different and more powerful. probably partly because of my intentionality and partly because Spirit.\n\nreality really does seem to be what we make it. hm!\n\n\n\nIn the presence of our all powerful, all knowing, and all present Creator by what ever name you call It we Pour\nAXE’\n\nWe pour for our Celestial ancestors known in different cultures by different names. to some they are known as Orisha, to some they are known as Neteru, to some Angels we pour for them\nAXE’\n\nIn the presence of our ancient ancestors. Those that existed before our Maafa. those that existed before our captivity… feel free to call names….we pour\nAXE’\n\nIn the presence of our ancestors who died during the middle passage and our Maafa, we pour…..\nAXE’\n\nWe pour for Universal Ancestors.

        "content": "just sharing a few quick thoughts from the past couple of days:\n\n\n  taking a sabbath day: i observed shabbat friday (yesterday) sundown, 508p, until sundown today ~512p. on the way into it, i felt more anxiety than i have in a really long time. i was/am so “behind” on things and i owe so many people (particularly friends i care a lot about and have begun to do professional work with) so many things. i kept thinking “if i just worked all day tomorrow, i could totally catch up.” i resisted that and observed shabbat anyways because there will always be more work to do. the muscle i am trying to build by observing shabbat is recognition that there will always be more work to do and resting needs to happen either way. as of right now, i am really glad i did! we’ll see how that feels come next week, though…\n    \n      i want a more ritualistic way to break this sabbath… today i broke it by texting. lame.\n    \n  \n  non-attachment: i have been working intensely with non-attachment lately. trying to hold it in as many ways and places as possible. it really is a mindfuck. even in a conversation last week someone said to me “oh wow, you’re really being devil’s advocaty’ today aren’t you?” and i just said, “well, it’s just really easy to get caught up in stories that may or may not be true. and either way, things that are real one minute can shift in the next one. so it’s just better and easier to be grounded and hold every moment and situation as if it could change… because it could!”\n    \n      funny related story: i was on the orange line train on friday and an orange i was going to eat as a snack fell out of my bag. as it rolled off, i made a slight groan but then accepted the loss and watched it hit someone else’s foot. i hoped whoever it hit would pick it up and get a nice gift for that day. i returned to my book and thought that was that. but as the train pulled into mass. ave station, the momentum of the train car reverse and the orange started rolling back. as i watched, it came right towards me! just as the train was stopping, i stuck my foot out and stopped the orange in its tracks! i reached down, picked it up, put it in my bag, and basically waltzed off the train. UNREAL! talk about feeling magical as fuck lol. what’s the lesson here? i don’t even know, but i’m listening!!!\n    \n  \n  thanks to those of you who have reached out regarding my avoidance post! i’m just dropping nisha’s response here so i can find it without going back into my email:\n\n\nfrom nisha:\n\nHere’s what is dropping in for me in response to your question,\n\n\n  when you know where you’re headed but you are stuck, what do you do to get yourself unstuck? how do you take a step forward?\n\n\n\n  I move energy in my body and spirit through drumming, singing, yoga asanas, or dance that involves lots of rolling of my hips. (Luana planted the seed for this practice when once inviting me to break up grant writing with 5-10 min jams on my cajon)\n  I reflect on my inner critics and which of these may be holding me back from taking a step forward out a sense of protection. I engage in dialogue (journaling) with the one(s) who seems to be most present and assure this critic(s) that my experiences, wisdom, awarenesses, skills, and gifts are enough for the steps I want to take.\n  I imagine the smallest step I can take in the direction of my vision and make time to take it in the next 48 hours.\n\n\nWith regards to our shadow energy, a former coach recommended reading Owning Your Own Shadow –Understanding the Dark Side of the Psyche by Robert A. Johnson as part of my coaching work with her. I recall it helping me understand my shadow energy as a potent source of my creativity. It may speak to you as you embark on your shadow work.

Love is a revolution.\n\nLove makes clear every fear we must work through. Love brings with it every reason to make such effort. Love initiates us, leaving us forever changed, forever marked, forever awakened to what could be.\n\nThe love we cultivate, the love we elevate, the love we choose to accentuate speaks volumes about who we are and how we define our lives.  Love isn’t romance alone, but the most platonic of relationships can be the most romantic. Love is the only thing worth decorating oneself, and ones life, with and for.\n\nLove needs to be at the center of all we do if we are to do it for long. Love needs our actions because it starves on words alone. Love needs our solidarity because it shrivels up in isolation.\n\nThis world has no shortages of opportunities to demonstrate love out loud. May we use each one that comes our way. May our love crack the shields that loneliness creates. May our actions create more spaces for love to flourish.\n\nThis week’s horoscopes are (reworked and) republished from February 2017, I hope they still serve you well. They were, and are, written as inspirations to help us understand, accept, and possibly love each other, and ourselves, a little better.\n\nThe sign that the sun was in when we were born is only one part of our astrological chart, far from the whole of it. You may therefore, want to read the horoscope for the signs that your sun, moon, rising, and Venus are in, for yourself and your loved ones. You’ll know which parts of each of them resonate with you the most, as always, leave the rest.\n\nAries (my sun sign)\n\nLove the fire. Love the passion. Love the energy.\n\nLove them like they are or leave them alone. Love them without asking them to stay in one place. Love them for all that they stir up. Love them for the energy that they have to channel day in and day out. Like a live wire, Aries possesses a tremendous wattage. That’s no easy task. It can leave one burnt out, freaked out or on fire with the latest inspiration.\n\nThey need many outlets.\n\nThey need indirect encouragement to focus on the activities that are productive and proactive. They need to find solutions to their problems themselves or they won’t respect what they have won.\n\nIf you love an Aries, love the way they set themselves and life into motion. Love the way they fill empty space with their energy. Love the way they burst onto the scene. Without thinking about the consequences.\n\nLove them through every scuffle but refuse to let them pick a fight with you just to let off steam. Love them through the wild bouts of energy that they are asked to manage but don’t let their style steamroll your own needs. Love the fact that they are willing to test the limits of their heart through the boundaries of the relationship they are in with you. Hold them accountable. They will love you all the more for it.\n\nLove their bravery and their ability to encourage your own.\n\nBe a worthy opponent by being honest and unwilling to be bossed. Be willing to push back out of a deep dedication to your love for them. Be dedicated to your own independence and let your relationship with them be a testament to what can happen when people come together to honor one another’s spirit.\n\n\n\nVirgo (my moon)\n\nLove the precision. Love the thoughtfulness. Love the sincerity.\n\nTo love a Virgo is to love that they may not know how to leave well enough alone. Love that they may not know how to let go when there are jobs left undone. Love that they may want to sort instead of consort until there’s quality company to be had.\n\nNotice the work that they have done to make your life easier. Applaud them for the carefully curated problem solving they have provided for you. Make an effort to understand how their worry manifests. Hyper-criticism will arise when they feel unsafe, unsettled, or unfulfilled. Rather than engaging with the critique, engage with the underlying stressor. Let them know that you are holding their story with them. Following the plot. Connecting the dots. Ready to work it out at a moment’s notice.\n\nOnce Virgo understands your ability to roll up your sleeves and put the effort in, the well-earned, hard-won respect you get from them is no ordinary praise. Virgo can be demanding, but Virgo will never forget your favorites, your needs, and your necessities. They might not call for your attention all the time, but once you get theirs, they’ll make a ritual out of reminding you how special you are.\n\n\n\nAquarius (my rising)\n\nLove the clarity. Love the certainty. Love the strength that they constantly communicate to the world.\n\nLove their ability to care more about getting their point across than pandering to the feelings of those in power. Nothing impresses this sign save for the ability to think for oneself. Not swayed by public opinion, able to see past the fears that most humans let their thinking get bound up in, Aquarius aims for the truth and will pick you when they know that you are it.\n\nTo be loved by an Aquarius is to be respected. To be loved by an Aquarius is to be loved for your own merit. To be loved by an Aquarius is to be loved out of choice, never out of duty.\n\nTo love an Aquarius is to love being constantly astounded by how quickly they understand a system, situation or subtlety. To love an Aquarius means introducing them to the fact that facts sometimes can hurt your feelings. Facts don’t always need to be the first thing spoken. Some hearts need time to adjust to the truth.\n\nTo love and be loved by Aquarius means that autonomy is a turn on for you both, and space is sacred, necessary, and needed if the embers of the heart are to be kept alive and aglow.\n",

        "content": "source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-aquarius-2019-horoscopes/\n\nAries\n\nbasic personality &amp; ego\n\nAligning myself with the people, places, and actions that bring me closer to my dreams is my main priority. There are a million distractions, doubts, and fears to get caught up in daily. There are a million ways in which I have been taught to devalue my vision, to denigrate it, to convince myself that I am not the answer to it as much as it is to me. But my destiny is to be met on a two-way street.\n\nIt needs me to make room for it every day. Aligning myself with what I most want to manifest is something I have to consciously do. Repeatedly. Daily. Enthusiastically if possible. Honestly, always.\n\nIf I am being truthful, when unchecked I will tend to grasp for what might make my ego momentarily happy. A place. A thing. A person. An idea of success, love, or acceptance. But unless achieved in a way that deepens my connection to myself, my loves, my life, and my world, nothing will satisfy my soul’s desire to do good work with good people.\n\nI want to know what it means to feel aligned with my life’s purpose so deeply that I never refuse the challenges, victories and defeats along the way. I don’t waste my time chasing fool’s gold. I want the glimmer to be inner, first and foremost.\n\nAquarius Rising\n\nhow others experience me\n\nI am renewed each time I allow myself to move thoroughly through a process. Each time I allow myself to reach the bottom, to ground, to land. Bouncing back is not necessarily the end-game, but unless I get to the bottom of things, I’ll never be able to.\n\nEach time I allow myself to look up. Stretch up. Rise up towards the light. I am refusing to stay in the shadows of my past. Each time I allow myself the luxury of cycling through my process without feeling rushed or overly attached to any one part of it, my energy is regenerated.\n\nI am renewed each time I remember that life is not something I figure out, but something I find a way to be in partnership with. Each time I try to pin my possibilities down into a definite answer, I am deadening the energy of everything else that is trying to flow towards me. With this new moon I release the need to know how, what, where, or with whom things will work out and instead I focus on the direction I feel pulled towards in this moment. Every time I gather my energy, recalling it from the past, I am reinvesting in myself, this moment, and all the possibility it possesses.\n\nVirgo\n\nmoon: inner self &amp; deepest emotions\n\nI find every avenue possible to love the labor. As much as I take advantage of rest. As much as I honor my downtime. As much as I revel in my free-time, to the best of my ability I find things to adore about my work.\n\nIf I want bounty to come from my efforts, I have to make peace with the practice that goes into creating it. The secret to my success is loving the process, not just the performance.\n\nI leave room for opportunity. I remember not to get too rigid in how I think my work or efforts will be received, what they will amount to, or where they will go. I work in ways that help to regenerate my creative energy. I work in ways that keep me focus on the reasons that I do what I do. To the best of my ability, I clear out what leaves me feeling cluttered, muddled, or confused about my direction. I am here to work towards what will bring the most joy and healing to the most people, places, and causes.\n",

Mystics cannot prevent themselves from becoming social critics, since in self-reflection they will discover the roots of a sick society. Similarly, revolutionaries cannot avoid facing their own human condition, since in the midst of their struggle for a new world they will find that they are also fighting their own reactionary fears and false ambitions.”\n\n\n\n  “When we wonder why the language of tradition Christianity has lost its liberation power for nuclear man, we have to realize that most Christian preaching is still based on the presupposition that man sees himself as meaningfully integrated with a history in which God came to us in the past, is living under us in the present, and will come to liberate us in the future. But when man’s historical consciousness is broken, the whole Christian message seems like a lecture about the great pioneers to a boy on an acid trip.”\n\n\n(and the next paragraph of the above quote)\n\n\n  But how can we avoid this danger? I think by no other way than to enter ourselves first of all into the center of our existence and become familiar with the complexities of our inner lives. As soon as we feel at home in our own house, discover the dark corners as well as the light spots, the closed doors as well as the drafty roos, our confusion will evaporate, our anxiety will diminish, and we will become capable of creative work.\n\n\ni love that one because it’s my new definition and purpose for doing shadow work (which i’ve been talking to some of yall about). i’m adding these words to words already in my mind/heart that two of yall have shared with me. &lt;3\n\n\n  But just as bread given without love can bring war instead of peace, professionalism without compassion will turn forgiveness into a gimmick, and the kingdon to come into a blindfold.\n\n\n",

        "content": "source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-pisces-march-2019/\n\nAries\n\nbasic personality &amp; ego\n\nMemories, and the emotions attached to them bring information that I never refuse. Timing is everything and any part of my past that is being recovered right now is worth investigating.  Even briefly. I know not to hang on to what is moving through me, but I also know not to resist the current.\n\nI am both the container for my experience and the witness of how it pours forth.\n\nLike water overflowing, I allow my imagination to play with the possibilities of what it looks like to live into, through, and beyond the stories of my life. To survive is to defy.\n\nWhat I allow to define me is my choice, my point of power, and my right to change when and where I need to. With this new moon I am reminded to take note of what I am calling myself, how I am referring to myself, and what that infers to myself. I am here for my liberation, and anything that needs to be released on the way to my personal freedom must be given back to its owner.\n\nWithin the incubators that house my creative energy I give myself permission to regenerate. Here I reclaim myself, rename myself if need be, and remember that I am always becoming, undefined by what has happened to me or hasn’t happened for me.\n\nAquarius Rising\n\nhow others experience me\n\nWhat is mine to work with has always been and will always be.  I need not fight it, push it, or feel like someone else can take it from me. My resources may take their own time to develop, but they deserve every second they need to take shape. I trust that when the tide ebbs it will flow again. I trust that the projects that wash up on shore are gifts for me to develop. I know that anything that gets lost at sea need not concern me.\n\nI am here to work on what is in front of me. No fantasy. Just the reality of working towards my dreams with every solid, grounded,  effort I can make. I no longer place my talent, time, and resources into containers too leaky to hold them. Ideas without action aren’t failures, they are foolish to focus on. If I want it, I work towards it. Inwardly and outwardly.\n\nI’m healing my relationship to my financial life no matter the damage, drain, or despair that I’ve experienced because of it. I am not at the whim of my livelihood, but the curator in relationship with it and all it might be able to do.\n\nVirgo\n\nmoon: inner self &amp; deepest emotions\n\nI am made stronger by every moment of vulnerability I have allowed myself. Even when I’m met with less warmth than I’d hoped from others, I’m still fortified by my own efforts. Being honest in front of others takes courage. I am willing to look like a human who makes both mistakes and as many attempts to get it right as it requires. I am willing to be humbled by all that I still need to learn. I am willing to be misunderstood on the way to being known.\n\nI’m in no rush to be right.\n\nMy relationships require me to learn how to be open to my own experience when I’d rather shut down, shut you out, or shut the door completely. When I am able to hang out in the moments of wanting to do so, without actually doing so, I know that growth is occurring. I know that change is possible. I know that from this place all the information I need becomes available to me. With much change on the horizon, I know that developing the skills to sit with what’s uncertain and uncomfortable is more than useful, it’s the most reliable compass I’ll ever have contact with.\n\nCancer\n\nchiron description from cafe astrology. shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.\n\n\n  Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.\n\n  Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.”.\n\n\nI honor the editing process that I am in. Like weeding an overgrown garden, I remove what is unhelpful in order to bring out the beauty naturally present.\n\nI work with this new moon to clear what clutters my path. Doubts that have no sense need to be dumped. Fears that have no foundation need to be exposed as the frauds that they are.  Shame that no longer serves a purpose needs to be shown the door. This clearing is mine to do. It can’t be shopped out, left for another, or put off.\n\nThis helps me take responsibility for the direction I am heading in, but it also helps me feel empowered in the process of doing so. The more I own my desire to head in the direction of my dreams, the less likely I am to resent the work necessary to get there.\n\nWith this new moon I claim the path that I am on, all that it asks of me, and all that it asks me to give up, miss out on, or forgo for it. I am crystal clear about the price and that the payoff is to merely be in this process with it.\n\nI use this Mercury retrograde to review my strategies, maps, and ways of getting from point A to B, making sure that they leave me open to get all the way to Z.\n",

        "content": "so first thing to share: this post about breadcrumbs on my regular blog is 100% a journey experience. that is the headline takeaway from this journey: only breadcrumbs can be left behind.\n\nthat leads to three actions for me:\n\n\n  find the breadcrumbs of my ancestors\n  make and eat this lifetime here and now (since i can’t leave it behind)\n  leave breadcrumbs for my descendants (bio and/or chosen)\n\n\nsome other thoughts about the process:\n\n\n  what is so magical to me about the combination of these particular medicines (let’s call one ‘heart’ and the other ‘forest’) is that they make my worldviews and limiting beliefs LITERAL and then, once i can see them, i usually get the chance to break through them. this happens in regular life too, but so much more slowly. it happens in journeyspace like every few minutes (if not faster).\n    \n      and in some ways, this is exhausting. i know the medicines have physical explanations as to why we feel tired or sore after moving them through our systems, but this rapid worldview shifting feels like the psychic facet.\n    \n  \n  so much can happen while the medicines are in me and what happens with those insights is continually expanded afterwards. after sleeping and waking up for integration, the discussion and thoughts from others who were in the space can flip, rotate, explode, or widen what i had previously thought the insight was. and as i have begun to integrate some of the thoughts and insights into my life this past week, i talk to people about them and they take on even more meaning/layers.\n  i wrote a TON during the early chunk of the journey when the medicine was coming on. i have never had the desire to write anything before in ceremony so i’m not sure what changed this time. more forest medicine? the small setting (1 guide, 1 co-journeymate)? the context? who knows…\n\n\nanyway, here’s a rundown of the breadcrumbs i left myself (know that this is probably 1/3 or less of what happened). things in brackets are descriptions of context. the breadcrumbs are in present tense (they’re only slightly edited version of what i actually wrote):\n\nthought flow 1:\n\n\n  [i started the journey laying down with my frog in my left hand, his stick in my right hand, one of my sweetgrass baskets on my belly and a polaroid of me holding my godson, asa shortly after his birth.] i don’t have visuals! of queer, christian fatherhood. does this mean i’m supposed to be a model of that? not committing to that now but noticing…\n  oh wait, maybe i do have models of that… they’re called monks. i just don’t want that model. i want more.\n  but on that tip… what does it look like to give birth to a soul? (note to self: talk to luana about this)\n    \n      look into baptism as a practice (also eroc baptized me on cortes island)\n    \n  \n  i’ve been getting a lot of signals about my throat chakra lately but in this moment i think what’s coming up for me is that the blockage i need to clear isn’t mine… it’s my dad’s! maybe he is my closest model of queer christian fatherhood. holy shit.\n  actually, so maybe the modeling that’s needed is queer, christian, black fatherhood?\n    \n      need to have some gentle/hard convos with my dad about all those “friends” of his we used to visit\n      also i think part of my own history of sexual abuse happened while we were visiting “friends” or family and i spent lots of time in my male “cousins” bedrooms playing video games and… why are there gaps in my memory here? this is either just forgetting or sexual trauma. gotta go there someday but not today.\n    \n  \n\n\nabbreviated thought flow 2:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nok this back me in present time. i just got a text from my ex’s dad that my ex just got arrested again. gotta go deal… ugh! to be continued…\n",

        "content": "march 29 thru april 6 i was in corbett, oregon, for my css job. we had our big annual 5-day training called the advanced training and i was on the staff planning and support team. it was overall an amazing time. here are some photos of the training and staff team, of one of the evenings, and of one of the training days.\n\ntwo things i want to share here though because of the “spiritual” nature of them.\n\nfirst, my (new) friend, jess st. louis, found out that a friend was murdered by the police on one of the days of the training. devastating.\n\n[pause]\n\ni just want to note that i really really did and do feel the weight of that experience. what i’m about to say next is journaling about my side of the experience, but i hope it doesn’t come off as trivializing the experience of a murder…\n\n[pausing again and taking a deep breath]\n\nwhat i want to say about that situation was that i followed my intuition lots and it was good. two trainers and i went to jess while she was holding the initial news and in tears. it was in the morning, but eventually, the trainers had to go back to their small groups. it turned out to be really great that i wasn’t on the training team. i could stay behind and hold space for jess while the other trainers went back to their responsibilities.\n\ni just sat with jess and we breathed and she did a somatic grounding practice (she’s a student of generative somatics) and just held each other’s gaze and it was good. i shared a few thoughts (literally don’t remember what i said… #Spiritwastalking) and gave a few ideas of how she should move forward with the next few hours. before leaving, she said she wanted to check-in with me after her time alone to have me see if she was actually ready to go back to her training group or if she needed more time. i said i could definitely do that. then she went to walk by the water (we were on the columbia river).\n\ni took my comboschini and walked the labyrinth to do my own grounding. how awesome was it that there was a labyrinth onsite?!\n\nin a magical unveiling of some sacred geometry, i found that if i said my mantra (“i am the love of the universe”) per bead, it ended up being me getting to the center of the maze. and then i did the same on the way out. so i got 200 mantras in and by the time i got back inside, jess was looking for me! unreal timing.\n\nshe and i went to go sit on a bench near a hummingbird feeder and overlooking the water. we had a good chat and i felt that she needed a little more time solo before going back. she thought my assessment was totally right and took the time before heading back in to her group.\n\nfast forward to the last day of the retreat: on the way out, jess says to me “not only was it helpful, it was an honor to be held and supported by you as i handled that news. thank you.”\n\n:O\n\nok, will have to share the second thought another time… i could just write SO much. interesting…\n\nsee part 2\n",

        "content": "back to part 1\n\npart 2! the second thought is about the 2nd half of the training. i’m going to keep it short so that i’m not late for my call in 3 mins:\n\ni had a few agenda sections during the week, mostly 5 or fewer minutes long. each of them was to talk about my role as network engagement coordinator and to discuss network weaving vs networking. each time i got up in front of the room, the reception was pretty good!\n\non wednesday, one of the co-directors asked me if i would be willing to take on and lead with an activity a big chunk of the friday agenda. i waffled but said yes a few hours later.\n\nthen on thursday, she asked if i would be willing to close the entire gathering! i was like… you mean instead of you or the other co-director or our other colleague who has been to SIX of these trainings? she said “yup. it seems like people are craving a bit more spirituality. that seems like what you’re bringing and me and [other co-director] aren’t really feeling like we can bring that…. so think about it. get back to me.”\n\ni thought about it and was definitely hesitant for all the usual reasons…\n\n\n  why me?\n  what if i mess it up?\n  i’m the only man present on staff at the training… that feels weird\n\n\nand the biggest questions of all: what if i actually do a good job? what if this was the way it was meant to happen?\n\nafter sleeping on it, i said yes.\n\nthankfully, the closing activity was already decided (it was one that was from a previuos year); i just had to lead it. but i did it and i think it was good. there was definitely an awkward moment or two, but it was definitely definitely progress.\n\na few other notes from the week:\n\n\n  my nervousness of speaking in front of groups has diminished substantially this past year\n  writing out my talking points is a good practice for me. and even if i don’t look at them as i’m speaking, the process of distilling my whole shpeel into bulles really helps me remember them when i’m up\n  when i speak about things i actually know about, it’s easy to talk and even ramble. when i’m less familiar or less comfy, things get weird, heh.\n\n\nok! that’s all for now! thanks for listening.\n\n",
