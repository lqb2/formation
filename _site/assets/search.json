This commitment to my transformation is in support of my own movement towards liberation which, in turn and simultaneously is a necessary driver and element of liberation for our species (and beyond). In order to authentically use my gift / responsibility (supporting transformation), I must have the experience of my own transformation.\n\nPractice\nI will remind myself of my commitment by reading it aloud weekly, ideally during Sabbath. \nI will document my process weekly (maybe as a way to break my Sabbath) by writing and taking photos to share with my small group as well as my formation team. \nI will work with tarot daily. \nI will engage in journey work with plant medicine. \nI will meditate daily for 20+ minutes and have at least one 60 minute session per week.\n\nSupport and Inspiration\nI know that this will not be easy. I will remember to return to my commitment when I struggle or want to back out of this work. I will preemptively ask my elder to check in on me every two weeks. I will make sure that my formation small group and team knows my telltale signs of struggle and avoidance: poor time-management, lack of high-quality sleep, and under-communication about what is happening. When I feel overwhelmed, I will scale back to my minimum viable ritual: meditation.\n\nTo What End\nI make this commitment with my whole heart, knowing it may involve unforeseen challenges and disruption to the life I have known. It is worth doing because the gift, the medicine I have is useless unless it is shared. I have seen previous iterations of impact when I am doing my work in the world and now it is time to level up. Why now? The increasingly chaotic world we live in will require everything we have if our species is going to survive. I recognize and accept that the survival our species is not a necessity; species go extinct all the time. ‘Everything we have’ includes what I have and I am ready to step even farther into what that is so that I can play my part in this beautiful, universal love song of life and death.\n",

We must realize that this axe’ is always present, but when we consciously call it into our presence we have the opportunity to bless ourselves and others. If we play with it we can do great harm to ourselves and everyone in the room. If the leader of the ritual is not focused and consciously calls this energy into a room that is not ready it is like having a energy surge in your house, a fuse can be blown. But  instead of the lights going out in the house (which they can), the metaphoric lights in some of the participants lives go out (unbalanced events can begin to happen).\n\n\nso now i’ve shifted my daily question from “what do i need to know today?” to “ancestors, what do i need to know today?” it’s a seemingly tiny shift, but my pulls yesterday and today already feel different and more powerful. probably partly because of my intentionality and partly because Spirit.\n\nreality really does seem to be what we make it. hm!\n\n\n\nIn the presence of our all powerful, all knowing, and all present Creator by what ever name you call It we Pour\nAXE’\n\nWe pour for our Celestial ancestors known in different cultures by different names. to some they are known as Orisha, to some they are known as Neteru, to some Angels we pour for them\nAXE’\n\nIn the presence of our ancient ancestors. Those that existed before our Maafa. those that existed before our captivity… feel free to call names….we pour\nAXE’\n\nIn the presence of our ancestors who died during the middle passage and our Maafa, we pour…..\nAXE’\n\nWe pour for Universal Ancestors. The One’s that researched and taught us who we are. those freedom fighters that stood for what was and is right…. feel free to call names….. we pour…\nAXE’\n\nWe pour for our Personal ancestors. Those who gave birth to us, nurtured us and taught us. feel free to call names….. we pour\nAXE’\n\nWe pour to welcome the the present moment. We salute the power of the moment, and salute the the ever present now….we pour\nAXE’\n\nWe pour for our future generations. We remember them now and build for them, so that they can one day pour for us…we pour\nAXE’\n\nWe pour to the seven directions to west, north, east, south, the up, the down and we pour for the center which dwells in each of us…we pour\nAXE’\n\nWe pour for the 5 elements , we pour for the fire, earth, air, water, and the life that they all combine and make… we pour\nAXE’\n\nWe pour for each individual here and any issues that you would like to share feel free to shout them out….. we pour \nAXE’\n\nWhich brings us back to where we started. We began with the Creator and we end with the Creator we pour 3 times …….\nAXE’ AXE’ AXE’\n",
