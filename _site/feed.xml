&lt;p&gt;the other day i was sitting in the barbershop texting kendra. we were talking about scheduling a phone call and i was being all sorts of weird about it. i realized this in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she asked me for some dates that worked during a particular week. i responded with a message about being out of town for three days that week. then the below conversation ensued…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aZoqaud.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i worked through my own stuff, kendra saw that last message from me and then said something that literally rocked my world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JMHgjkZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i teared up right then and there in the barbershop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i didn’t realize how tightly i hold onto my fear of disappointing other people!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;kendra and i texted some more and she said (paraphrased) “given what you said, i could feel that you needed to hear that from me. don’t ever worry about disappointing me, and especially not when you’re taking space to do what you need to do for yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ho. lee. shit. i am leveled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gonna be sitting with this for some days/weeks/months. how many situations in my life are shaped by this belief of mine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i will shift it in time, but for now, just noticing and reflecting… wow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">story.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Horoscopes for the New Moon in Aquarius – February 2019</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/02/17/new-moon-in-aquarius/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Horoscopes for the New Moon in Aquarius – February 2019" /><published>2019-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/02/17/new-moon-in-aquarius</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/02/17/new-moon-in-aquarius/">&lt;p&gt;source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-aquarius-2019-horoscopes/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aries&quot;&gt;Aries&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;basic personality &amp;amp; ego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aligning myself with the people, places, and actions that bring me closer to my dreams is my main priority. There are a million distractions, doubts, and fears to get caught up in daily.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a million ways in which I have been taught to devalue my vision, to denigrate it, to convince myself that I am not the answer to it as much as it is to me. &lt;strong&gt;But my destiny is to be met on a two-way street.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It needs me to make room for it every day. Aligning myself with what I most want to manifest is something I have to consciously do. Repeatedly. Daily.&lt;/strong&gt; Enthusiastically if possible. Honestly, always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am being truthful, &lt;strong&gt;when unchecked I will tend to grasp for what might make my ego momentarily happy&lt;/strong&gt;. A place. A thing. A person. An idea of success, love, or acceptance. But &lt;strong&gt;unless achieved in a way that deepens my connection to myself, my loves, my life, and my world, nothing will satisfy my soul’s desire to do good work with good people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to know what it means to feel aligned with my life’s purpose&lt;/strong&gt; so deeply that I never refuse the challenges, victories and defeats along the way. &lt;strong&gt;I don’t waste my time chasing fool’s gold.&lt;/strong&gt; I want the glimmer to be inner, first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aquarius-rising&quot;&gt;Aquarius Rising&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how others experience me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am renewed each time I allow myself to move thoroughly through a process. Each time I allow myself to reach the bottom, to ground, to land. Bouncing back is not necessarily the end-game, but unless I get to the bottom of things, I’ll never be able to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each time I allow myself to look up.&lt;/strong&gt; Stretch up. Rise up towards the light. &lt;strong&gt;I am refusing to stay in the shadows of my past.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Each time I allow myself the luxury of cycling through my process without feeling rushed or overly attached to any one part of it, my energy is regenerated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am renewed each time I remember that life is not something I figure out, but something I find a way to be in partnership with.&lt;/strong&gt; Each time I try to pin my possibilities down into a definite answer, I am deadening the energy of everything else that is trying to flow towards me. &lt;strong&gt;With this new moon I release the need to know how, what, where, or with whom things will work out&lt;/strong&gt; and instead I focus on the direction I feel pulled towards in this moment. &lt;strong&gt;Every time I gather my energy, recalling it from the past, I am reinvesting in myself, this moment, and all the possibility it possesses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;virgo&quot;&gt;Virgo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;moon: inner self &amp;amp; deepest emotions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I find every avenue possible to love the labor.&lt;/strong&gt; As much as I take advantage of rest. As much as I honor my downtime. As much as I revel in my free-time, to the best of my ability I find things to adore about my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I want bounty to come from my efforts, I have to make peace with the practice that goes into creating it. &lt;strong&gt;The secret to my success is loving the process&lt;/strong&gt;, not just the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave room for opportunity. &lt;strong&gt;I remember not to get too rigid in how I think my work or efforts will be received, what they will amount to, or where they will go.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I work in ways that help to regenerate my creative energy.&lt;/strong&gt; I work in ways that keep me focus on the reasons that I do what I do. &lt;strong&gt;To the best of my ability, I clear out what leaves me feeling cluttered, muddled, or confused about my direction.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am here to work towards what will bring the most joy and healing to the most people, places, and causes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-aquarius-2019-horoscopes/</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a walk in the arboretum</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/02/17/known-and-unknown/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a walk in the arboretum" /><published>2019-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/02/17/known-and-unknown</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/02/17/known-and-unknown/">&lt;p&gt;this write up is more brief than the weight it carries, but i’ve been trying to write it for three days and not doing it because i’m overblowing the time it needs in my mind. working on moving through that by sharing here in short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last week i committed to a bringing a new spiritual practice into my regular ritual flows. i guess it’s actually just a modification, but i’m going to shift my usual saturday 1h sitting meditation into a Spirit walk. ideally it’ll be through the arnold arboretum, but wherever i can find some nature will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today, i went on my first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was prompted because i was going to be hosting full moon circle later and the last time i held one, i did 1h in the arb and it felt like what was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so today i walked in my usual gate and felt drawn to a path i’ve often looked at but had never taken before. as i walked, i reveled in getting to know the new territory. and soon enough, i found myself near the shrub and vine collect where the bonsai collection is (learning: the bonsai collection is only available outdoors april - nov)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i stumbled onto that familar place i was reminded that i love that sensation! the feel of finding my way to a place i know but from a totally new angle. i love love love when this happens in cities! often when i’m new to a city i’ll see lots of it for starters and then i’ll settle into areas near where i live and get to know those areas really well. then, as i start to expand and explore again, i’ll find myself back to places i visited early on but didn’t realize how they connected to my usual pathways. it’s the “omg THAT’S where this road goes” moment. i literally love those moments…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then it dawned on me: that’s what deep internal work looks and feels like. the work of self-exploration and also integration is just the process of exploring the unknown paths between known areas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;phew. maybe that was a lot more intense in my head or for me than it is for you, but it feels like a major breakthrough for me! :D&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">this write up is more brief than the weight it carries, but i’ve been trying to write it for three days and not doing it because i’m overblowing the time it needs in my mind. working on moving through that by sharing here in short:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">how to love me</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/02/15/how-to-love-me/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="how to love me" /><published>2019-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/02/15/how-to-love-me</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/02/15/how-to-love-me/">&lt;p&gt;thanks, luana, for sharing this. every bit of this felt relevant. holy cow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love is a risk. Love is a loss. Love is a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love makes clear every fear we must work through. Love brings with it every reason to make such effort. Love initiates us, leaving us forever changed, forever marked, forever awakened to what could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The love we cultivate, the love we elevate, the love we choose to accentuate speaks volumes about who we are and how we define our lives.  Love isn’t romance alone, but the most platonic of relationships can be the most romantic. Love is the only thing worth decorating oneself, and ones life, with and for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love needs to be at the center of all we do if we are to do it for long. Love needs our actions because it starves on words alone. Love needs our solidarity because it shrivels up in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This world has no shortages of opportunities to demonstrate love out loud. May we use each one that comes our way. May our love crack the shields that loneliness creates. May our actions create more spaces for love to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s horoscopes are (reworked and) republished from February 2017, I hope they still serve you well. They were, and are, written as inspirations to help us understand, accept, and possibly love each other, and ourselves, a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sign that the sun was in when we were born is only one part of our astrological chart, far from the whole of it. You may therefore, want to read the horoscope for the signs that your sun, moon, rising, and Venus are in, for yourself and your loved ones. You’ll know which parts of each of them resonate with you the most, as always, leave the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aries-my-sun-sign&quot;&gt;Aries (my sun sign)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love the fire. Love the passion. Love the energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love them like they are or leave them alone. Love them without asking them to stay in one place. Love them for all that they stir up. Love them for the energy that they have to channel day in and day out. Like a live wire, Aries possesses a tremendous wattage. That’s no easy task. It can leave one burnt out, freaked out or on fire with the latest inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They need many outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They need indirect encouragement to focus on the activities that are productive and proactive. They need to find solutions to their problems themselves or they won’t respect what they have won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love an Aries, love the way they set themselves and life into motion. Love the way they fill empty space with their energy. Love the way they burst onto the scene. Without thinking about the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love them through every scuffle but refuse to let them pick a fight with you just to let off steam. Love them through the wild bouts of energy that they are asked to manage but don’t let their style steamroll your own needs. Love the fact that they are willing to test the limits of their heart through the boundaries of the relationship they are in with you. Hold them accountable. They will love you all the more for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love their bravery and their ability to encourage your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be a worthy opponent by being honest and unwilling to be bossed. Be willing to push back out of a deep dedication to your love for them. Be dedicated to your own independence and let your relationship with them be a testament to what can happen when people come together to honor one another’s spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;virgo-my-moon&quot;&gt;Virgo (my moon)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love the precision. Love the thoughtfulness. Love the sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To love a Virgo is to love that they may not know how to leave well enough alone. Love that they may not know how to let go when there are jobs left undone. Love that they may want to sort instead of consort until there’s quality company to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the work that they have done to make your life easier. Applaud them for the carefully curated problem solving they have provided for you. Make an effort to understand how their worry manifests. Hyper-criticism will arise when they feel unsafe, unsettled, or unfulfilled. Rather than engaging with the critique, engage with the underlying stressor. Let them know that you are holding their story with them. Following the plot. Connecting the dots. Ready to work it out at a moment’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Virgo understands your ability to roll up your sleeves and put the effort in, the well-earned, hard-won respect you get from them is no ordinary praise. Virgo can be demanding, but Virgo will never forget your favorites, your needs, and your necessities. They might not call for your attention all the time, but once you get theirs, they’ll make a ritual out of reminding you how special you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aquarius-my-rising&quot;&gt;Aquarius (my rising)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love the clarity. Love the certainty. Love the strength that they constantly communicate to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love their ability to care more about getting their point across than pandering to the feelings of those in power. Nothing impresses this sign save for the ability to think for oneself. Not swayed by public opinion, able to see past the fears that most humans let their thinking get bound up in, Aquarius aims for the truth and will pick you when they know that you are it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be loved by an Aquarius is to be respected. To be loved by an Aquarius is to be loved for your own merit. To be loved by an Aquarius is to be loved out of choice, never out of duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To love an Aquarius is to love being constantly astounded by how quickly they understand a system, situation or subtlety. To love an Aquarius means introducing them to the fact that facts sometimes can hurt your feelings. Facts don’t always need to be the first thing spoken. Some hearts need time to adjust to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To love and be loved by Aquarius means that autonomy is a turn on for you both, and space is sacred, necessary, and needed if the embers of the heart are to be kept alive and aglow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">thanks, luana, for sharing this. every bit of this felt relevant. holy cow.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">shame</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/02/13/shame/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="shame" /><published>2019-02-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/02/13/shame</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/02/13/shame/">&lt;p&gt;what’s coming up for me right now? shame! holy cow is it coming up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taking a sabbath day&lt;/strong&gt;: i observed shabbat friday (yesterday) sundown, 508p, until sundown today ~512p. on the way into it, i felt more anxiety than i have in a really long time. i was/am so “behind” on things and i owe so many people (particularly friends i care a lot about and have begun to do professional work with) so many things. i kept thinking “if i just worked all day tomorrow, i could totally catch up.” i resisted that and observed shabbat anyways because there will always be more work to do. the muscle i am trying to build by observing shabbat is recognition that there will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be more work to do and resting needs to happen either way. as of right now, i am really glad i did! we’ll see how that feels come next week, though…
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;i want a more ritualistic way to break this sabbath… today i broke it by texting. lame.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-attachment&lt;/strong&gt;: i have been working intensely with non-attachment lately. trying to hold it in as many ways and places as possible. it really is a mindfuck. even in a conversation last week someone said to me “oh wow, you’re really being devil’s advocaty’ today aren’t you?” and i just said, “well, it’s just really easy to get caught up in stories that may or may not be true. and either way, things that are real one minute can shift in the next one. so it’s just better and easier to be grounded and hold every moment and situation as if it could change… because it could!”
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;funny related story: i was on the orange line train on friday and an orange i was going to eat as a snack fell out of my bag. as it rolled off, i made a slight groan but then accepted the loss and watched it hit someone else’s foot. i hoped whoever it hit would pick it up and get a nice gift for that day. i returned to my book and thought that was that. but as the train pulled into mass. ave station, the momentum of the train car reverse and the orange started rolling back. as i watched, it came right towards me! just as the train was stopping, i stuck my foot out and stopped the orange in its tracks! i reached down, picked it up, put it in my bag, and basically waltzed off the train. UNREAL! talk about feeling magical as fuck lol. what’s the lesson here? i don’t even know, but i’m listening!!!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thanks to those of you who have reached out regarding my &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;avoidance post&lt;/a&gt;! i’m just dropping nisha’s response here so i can find it without going back into my email:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from nisha&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what is dropping in for me in response to your question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;when you know where you’re headed but you are stuck, what do you do to get yourself unstuck? how do you take a step forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I move energy in my body and spirit through drumming, singing, yoga asanas, or dance that involves lots of rolling of my hips. (Luana planted the seed for this practice when once inviting me to break up grant writing with 5-10 min jams on my cajon)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I reflect on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3iwHN7km--SFghvqBUZXlJ4HUcnN5LHdwycXpooYzo/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;inner critics&lt;/a&gt; and which of these may be holding me back from taking a step forward out a sense of protection. I engage in dialogue (journaling) with the one(s) who seems to be most present and assure this critic(s) that my experiences, wisdom, awarenesses, skills, and gifts are enough for the steps I want to take.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I imagine the smallest step I can take in the direction of my vision and make time to take it in the next 48 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to our shadow energy, a former coach recommended reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Owning-Your-Own-Shadow-Understanding/dp/0062504223/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=78408977302352&amp;amp;hvbmt=bp&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvqmt=p&amp;amp;keywords=owning+your+own+shadow&amp;amp;qid=1549729720&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=mh0b-20&quot;&gt;Owning Your Own Shadow –Understanding the Dark Side of the Psyche by Robert A. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; as part of my coaching work with her. I recall it helping me understand my shadow energy as a potent source of my creativity. It may speak to you as you embark on your shadow work. A warning that there is a fair amount of christian theological references in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">just sharing a few quick thoughts from the past couple of days:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">libations (part 2)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/02/03/libations-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="libations (part 2)" /><published>2019-02-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/02/03/libations-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/02/03/libations-2/">&lt;p&gt;i found another blog post on libations: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gyenyamejourney.com/2011/04/how-to-pour-libations.html&quot;&gt;gye-nyame journey: how to pour libations&lt;/a&gt;. there’s a really helpful narration of verbal libations that i’m going to do for a week or so with my tarot pulls and see what happens. the words for the libations are down below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, something i learned from that author is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Libations are very serious, because when we do them we invite the Universal axe’ (spirit) to be active in the room. We must realize that this axe’ is always present, but when we consciously call it into our presence we have the opportunity to bless ourselves and others. If we play with it we can do great harm to ourselves and everyone in the room. If the leader of the ritual is not focused and consciously calls this energy into a room that is not ready it is like having a energy surge in your house, a fuse can be blown. But  instead of the lights going out in the house (which they can), the metaphoric lights in some of the participants lives go out (unbalanced events can begin to happen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so now i’ve shifted my daily question from “what do i need to know today?” to “ancestors, what do i need to know today?” it’s a seemingly tiny shift, but my pulls yesterday and today already feel different and more powerful. probably partly because of my intentionality and partly because Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reality really does seem to be what we make it. hm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the presence of our all powerful, all knowing, and all present Creator by what ever name you call It we Pour
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pour for our Celestial ancestors known in different cultures by different names. to some they are known as Orisha, to some they are known as Neteru, to some Angels we pour for them
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the presence of our ancient ancestors. Those that existed before our Maafa. those that existed before our captivity… feel free to call names….we pour
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the presence of our ancestors who died during the middle passage and our Maafa, we pour…..
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pour for Universal Ancestors. The One’s that researched and taught us who we are. those freedom fighters that stood for what was and is right…. feel free to call names….. we pour…
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pour for our Personal ancestors. Those who gave birth to us, nurtured us and taught us. feel free to call names….. we pour
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pour to welcome the the present moment. We salute the power of the moment, and salute the the ever present now….we pour
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pour for our future generations. We remember them now and build for them, so that they can one day pour for us…we pour
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pour to the seven directions to west, north, east, south, the up, the down and we pour for the center which dwells in each of us…we pour
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pour for the 5 elements , we pour for the fire, earth, air, water, and the life that they all combine and make… we pour
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pour for each individual here and any issues that you would like to share feel free to shout them out….. we pour 
AXE’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to where we started. We began with the Creator and we end with the Creator we pour 3 times …….

&lt;p&gt;here we are at my first moment of truth. this is me being vulnerable not knowing where this is  going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday, i pulled the moon (reversed) and the 8 of swords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RLa62yE.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whether you know tarot or not, here are some intepretation thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the moon, in one way, is about working with the imagination and dreams (sometimes pleasant, sometimes terrifying). working with these things, where our shadows are, can generate fear because the things there are unknown. the moon reversed says that one is avoiding looking at the darkness. and then the 8 of swords is about blockage that isn’t actually forcefully holding the captive. the woman behind the swords isn’t actually locked in by then. she could walk around them if she wanted… but she has not yet taken that step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today, i pulled the world, also reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the world is about the supreme, divine union of unconscious, consciousness, and super-conscious, then blending of secular and spiritual, the merging of earth and heaven. and the union results in a dance. the truth revealed there to me is that the universe IS about movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when reversed, the message is stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today and yesterday all point to two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i am avoiding my shadow work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the way i avoid it is simple: by not taking &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s become clear to me in the last week &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; being busy is so detrimental to my life’s work: it allows me to avoid being with myself. and since i am the only vessel through which particular medicine can flow, if i don’t know how to be with myself, how will i know how to work with my magic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i say that it sounds extreme, but i guess what i really mean is that this is a moment to do some deep work and i need time and space to sit with it to do it. which means i’m at another moment of needing to clear some space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’ve been through this many times before and i have strong muscles around saying no… but it seems they need to get even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i feel good about my ability to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what i don’t feel good about how to start taking steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my ask to you: when you know where you’re headed but you are stuck, what do you do to get yourself unstuck? how do you take a step forward?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">so!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">libations</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/02/01/libations/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="libations" /><published>2019-02-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/02/01/libations</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/02/01/libations/">&lt;p&gt;today begins black history/futures month. excited for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i want to learn about libations (singular? plural?) so i’m starting to do that as the ritual practice before i shuffle my tarot deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i read &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalfaithministriesofchiism.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/libations-itu-mmai-7/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the practice of libations but i want more. if you know anything, would you please share or point me to another resource?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;finally, in honor of black history/futures month, i think i want to commit to writing flash fiction related to me and my lineage(s) every day. maybe it’s one story with many entries. maybe they’ll all be separate. who knows. either way, time to get writing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">today begins black history/futures month. excited for that.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">27 jan 2019</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/01/27/jan-27/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="27 jan 2019" /><published>2019-01-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/01/27/jan-27</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/01/27/jan-27/">&lt;p&gt;wanted to share my current morning tarot ritual/routine with yall.&lt;/p&gt;
