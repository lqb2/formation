&lt;p&gt;my intentions going in were &lt;em&gt;to be grounded and to let go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, the crew is full of powerful-ass people and i’m so excited for it. it’s a journey to advance our collective consciousness so the real work/progress will be measured in the collective capacity but here are some individual insights that came through this time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;s.g.: “last time i saw you as a spider… this time, you’re a crow.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;speaking my vision repeatedly is how i get less contraction around it. — in convo with a.n.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sometimes i do healing without even realizing i’m doing it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“you are the perfect thing! you are exactly what i need right now.” — o.t.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“i think you would be a perfect e.d. for [the org you work at].” — dcc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;o.t. might be my post-patriarchy futures collaborator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i now have three concrete memories to explore and do some healing work around concerning childhood sexual trauma. maybe in future sessions with this group or maybe that is separate work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;integration thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;s.t. gave us the prompt: what ignites your heart? thoughts i had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;knowing that the needs of my community are what turn on my magic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;knowing that i can be the perfect thing for someone, that i can be exactly what someone needs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remembering that what got me to where i am isn’t going to get to me to where i’m going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and some integration thoughts from other people…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;catalysts reduce the energy necessary for a reaction to occur. i/we are learning how to be catalysts. and there’s real biochemistry/mother earth to learn from here. — m.d.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wherever there is a gap in the me, it is filled by the we.” d.v.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you don’t clear the brush, it just makes for a bigger fire later. — ecc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i also wanted to write up what my body is doing/did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;while on this particular heart medicine, i always wreck the inside left of my jaw. next time, proactively ask for jaw support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;afterwards, my body is definitely tired.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so far, using this medicine i have yet to purge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i do notice a tightness or pressure in my stomach and lower belly before, during, and after.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after i also have to frequently remind myself to breathe deeply. i catch myself breathing shallowly often.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;my temples are always sore 1-2, maybe 3 afterwards. lots of jaw movement happens during so that makes sense as an aftereffect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok i think that’s it. thanks for traveling with me!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">saturday july 13 was the launch of the 2 year evolutionary relationships cohort. i’m feeling honored to be a part of it. i am going to start a little notebook (or maybe continue an existing journey notebook… gah, i think i have my journey notes in like three different places. my bullet journals and two small notebooks for journeys but one is for drumming journeys and the other is for plant medicine journeys… why did i do that?)</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">shamanism journal</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/07/07/shamanism-journal/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="shamanism journal" /><published>2019-07-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/07/07/shamanism-journal</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/07/07/shamanism-journal/">&lt;p&gt;readings:&lt;/p&gt;

[insert photos] there’s a sci-fi story in here somewhere about the connections between labyrinths…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;second note: i walked one of them yesterday with two co-workers and i walked the second one today for some grounding after a really hard moment on retreat. there’s probably more to say on that but that’s not what i wanted to say here… when i got to the center of the labyrinth, i found that people had left two stones/crystals, a heart pendant, and a bundle of (now dry) flowers. i wanted to leave something but i didn’t want to leave the stone or crystal i was carrying. i decided to leave nothing and was feeling kind of guilty about it. but on my way out i started picking up trash and then had the thought: “oh sometimes the gift one brings can be the removal of something.” and upon further reflection, i think that’s what a lot of healing work (especially when embedded in community) is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, that’s all for now. gotta go finish some work before bed!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">i think i had forgotten this but i’m super into labyrinths. there have been labyrinths at the site of the advanced training i was at back in april with css, there were two at the location of the united for a fair economy training of trainers location in north andover, there were two (though i only found one) at the garrison institute for waking up fabulous, and there are two where i am now at the site of our css staff retreat (in san anselmo on a satellite campus of the sf theological seminary).

&lt;p&gt;yesteday’s reading was totally fine and i think it was useful for the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just now though i did a reading that felt on fire. but, unsurprisingly, i think it had everything to do with the recipient. i also gave a presentation earlier today (each staff person gives a 15 min short presentation each retreat about a topic of their choosing that blurs the line between the personal and professional) on my formation work and how it relates to my job at the org. one of the 10 slides was about my tarot practice and i think that might have also had something to do with the recipient being receptive to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also she said she has been avoiding her clairvoyant abilities for her whole life. so there’s that too lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, it seemed like the reading unlocked lots for her and i felt a new level of access to my intuitive depth. and even in the 20 minutes after the reading, she texted me a breakthrough and real integration she’s had. it seems real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;super pumped about it! more readings coming up later this week for other staff members (at least two). we’ll see how they go…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">so i’m at the june 2019 css staff retreat and i have done two tarot readings, one yesterday and one today.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">june interesting moments</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/06/25/june-interesting-moments/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="june interesting moments" /><published>2019-06-25T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/06/25/june-interesting-moments</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/06/25/june-interesting-moments/">&lt;p&gt;ugh! i had a bunch of updates typed out and in my absent-mindedness i just saved over them. &lt;em&gt;angry face&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">ugh! i had a bunch of updates typed out and in my absent-mindedness i just saved over them. angry face</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Horoscopes for the New Moon in Gemini – June 2019</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/06/07/new-moon-in-gemini/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Horoscopes for the New Moon in Gemini – June 2019" /><published>2019-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/06/07/new-moon-in-gemini</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/06/07/new-moon-in-gemini/">&lt;p&gt;source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-pisces-march-2019/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aries&quot;&gt;Aries&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;basic personality &amp;amp; ego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The way to build a base is brick by brick.&lt;/strong&gt; Laying down my defensiveness in exchange for depth. &lt;strong&gt;Digging into the past in order to understand the dynamic of the present moment.&lt;/strong&gt; Smoothing out the wrinkles of unacknowledged feelings in order to let the energy flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The way to cure loneliness is one interaction at a time.&lt;/strong&gt; So I can absorb the wisdom delivered by my loved ones. So I can experience the depth of friendships in my life. So I can remember that my mind will tell me all manner of stories about how isolated I am, how unique my problems, and how precious my sorrows. &lt;strong&gt;But being with others that live honestly reminds me that my struggle is the human one, and I need not go it alone.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I know that if I rush through every interaction, every hurt feeling, every miscommunication, I can’t ever get to the healing. I won’t dwell in the pain of my past, but I won’t refuse its messages when they visit me in the present.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aquarius-rising&quot;&gt;Aquarius Rising&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how others experience me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspiration is unruly.&lt;/strong&gt; Wild. Untamable. Living beyond our timelines and confined calendars. &lt;strong&gt;I cannot summon it when it is convenient for me.&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot complain when it doesn’t oblige me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspiration arrives without warning and leaves without apology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left grateful for its gateway, I take any amount I am given and place it where I won’t forget about it. I build homes for it to visit. Gardens for it to plant itself in for a time. Gateways for it to saunter through when it wants to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I don’t rely on it in order to do my work. Instead I go to the canvas, drawing board, desk, and dancefloor with my dedication to being there.&lt;/strong&gt; I know that showing up for the creative process and listening to whatever it’s got for me that day is more than half the battle. &lt;strong&gt;I know that embracing my wildness means loving what I’ve been told is unacceptable. I know my shame and I am not put off by it. I know my fears and I am not stopped by them. I know what it means to fit in, and I am not here for any kind of conformity that divorces me from my precious, potent, life-giving, IDGAF-about-anything-but-the-truth, energy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;virgo&quot;&gt;Virgo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;moon: inner self &amp;amp; deepest emotions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My career is a cure for my past mistakes, mishaps, and misdirected energy. I pour my desire for anything I’ve yet to experience into the container of my public roles. &lt;strong&gt;I am here to give all that I have to the world. I am here to empty myself of all excess love, creative energy, and life lessons. Anything I have been given isn’t mine to keep, but it is my responsibility to share.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the world refuses to see me as a gift, I know otherwise. My sources are rock solid. I trust my intuition above the naysayers with nothing but negativity to offer. I know how resilient the energy that runs through me is, so I will trust it over the systems my situation finds me in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I get myself to the wells that refill me.&lt;/strong&gt; The sounding boards that hear me out. The courts that let me bounce my ideas around, &lt;strong&gt;giving me all sides of the story so that I can make the best decisions&lt;/strong&gt; and go in the directions that set my soul alight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chiron description from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cafeastrology.com/chiron.html&quot;&gt;cafe astrology&lt;/a&gt;. shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of the work that no one sees shows up in the finished product.&lt;/strong&gt; All the worrying, all the fussing, all the lullabies I sing to the creative projects that I want to bring into the world are palpable in the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work is to stay patient with the process. My work is to keep my awareness on what needs me most. &lt;strong&gt;My work is to not feel sorry for myself if I have to miss out on a moment in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attune myself to the bigger picture. I keep my focus on my long term goals. &lt;strong&gt;I know that anything that gives me temporary relief should be used, but only sparingly if it detracts too much from staying on the path of productive self-discovery.&lt;/strong&gt; I know that there is no such thing as personal perfection. Everytime I get caught in the net of such a deceptive foe, I feel my life force getting tangled, bound up, wrapped around energy channels that need to flow freely. &lt;strong&gt;I know that my best effort, done consistently, is the way to work. I know anyone holding me to another standard probably does the same with themselves, and that isn’t about me.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I leave what isn’t mine behind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-pisces-march-2019/</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">waking up fabulous and a month of other updates</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/05/29/silent-meditation-retreat/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="waking up fabulous and a month of other updates" /><published>2019-05-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/05/29/silent-meditation-retreat</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/05/29/silent-meditation-retreat/">&lt;p&gt;it’s been a while!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have currently committed to too much client work and so my writing about my formation work has been halted for the last month (it’s literally been one month since i last wrote) but the movement has DEFINITELY not halted. here are a few bullet points but there’s so much depth here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i finished reading decolonizing wealth. i am deeply in the process of shifting my relationship to wealth. it’s pretty wild. turns out, money is all about flow. let it flow out and let it flow in. right now, i’m feeling really excited to have flows that are allowing me to pay off my loans faster than expected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i just came back from a silent meditation retreat (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.garrisoninstitute.org/event/lgbtiq-retreat-waking-up-fabulous-taking-refuge-care-in-ourselves-the-practice-and-each-other/&quot;&gt;waking up fabulous&lt;/a&gt;) with danielle. she supported me (in many ways) to go and it was literally amazing. lots happened and opened up but two insights feels important right now:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;turns out, i can take 30 minute naps without an alarm. i left tiredness behind at the retreat and i’m stepping into liberation through naps. this is not a joke. naps are like the opposite of slavery.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;this came from convo with danielle: silent meditation is like medicine work but much slower and (therefore?) much more integrated. “it’s all ceremony.”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we shifted in the formation project from “inner” work to “outer work.” after some frustration in the transition, i’m learning that inner work and outer work are linked in a much closer way than i expected. like… my inner work practices literally can be transformed into my outer work. more on that to share later (i.e. the line between inner and outer is a (sometimes helpful) fiction)…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one of my outer practices is about using gardening to connect with my neighbors. since setting up the garden two weeks ago and setting that intention, i’ve had conversations with 5 new neighbors! it’s like magic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok. that’s all for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">it’s been a while!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">brief reflection on my new tarot deck</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/04/28/dust-to-onyx-tarot/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="brief reflection on my new tarot deck" /><published>2019-04-28T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/04/28/dust-to-onyx-tarot</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/04/28/dust-to-onyx-tarot/">&lt;p&gt;so last weekend, my friend, cameron, organized a bunch of my other friends to pitch in and get me a new tarot it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s funny because i have actually been (a) thinking/feeling that it was time for me to get a new deck and (b) eyeing the reprint of the dustiionyx deck for a bit and was sad i saw that the deck cost $150.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it felt AMAZING to see the deck when i opened the package on saturday night when everyone was around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i did some bonding with it on sunday morning and was really digging it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then monday came around and the resistance began to sink in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“woah, this deck is way too much for me! i’m in over my head… it’s like… so magical and so Black and so expansive and i’m not ready! there’s so much different: the elements, the court cards, the imagery…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then, Spirit was like… nah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one day last week, i saw luana at juicygreens and she said, totally unprompted, something like “yup. this deck is totally your level.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then i saw my friend, jess, and she said something like “dang, this deck seems just right for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:O :O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so. i guess it really is my deck. yikes. lol.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">so last weekend, my friend, cameron, organized a bunch of my other friends to pitch in and get me a new tarot it.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">surprising developments at the A.T.

&lt;p&gt;part 2! the second thought is about the 2nd half of the training. i’m going to keep it short so that i’m not late for my call in 3 mins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i had a few agenda sections during the week, mostly 5 or fewer minutes long. each of them was to talk about my role as network engagement coordinator and to discuss network weaving vs networking. each time i got up in front of the room, the reception was pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on wednesday, one of the co-directors asked me if i would be willing to take on and lead with an activity a big chunk of the friday agenda. i waffled but said yes a few hours later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then on thursday, she asked if i would be willing to &lt;em&gt;close the entire gathering!&lt;/em&gt; i was like… you mean instead of you or the other co-director or our other colleague who has been to SIX of these trainings? she said “yup. it seems like people are craving a bit more spirituality. that seems like what you’re bringing and me and [other co-director] aren’t really feeling like we can bring that…. so think about it. get back to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i thought about it and was definitely hesitant for all the usual reasons…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;why me?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what if i mess it up?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i’m the only man present on staff at the training… that feels weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the biggest questions of all: what if i actually do a good job? what if this was the way it was meant to happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after sleeping on it, i said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thankfully, the closing activity was already decided (it was one that was from a previuos year); i just had to lead it. but i did it and i &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it was good. there was definitely an awkward moment or two, but it was definitely definitely progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a few other notes from the week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;my nervousness of speaking in front of groups has diminished substantially this past year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing out my talking points is a good practice for me. and even if i don’t look at them as i’m speaking, the process of distilling my whole shpeel into bulles really helps me remember them when i’m up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when i speak about things i actually know about, it’s easy to talk and even ramble. when i’m less familiar or less comfy, things get weird, heh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok! that’s all for now! thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">back to part 1</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">surprising developments at the A.T.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/04/12/interesting-developments-at-the-AT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="surprising developments at the A.T." /><published>2019-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/04/12/interesting-developments-at-the-AT</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/04/12/interesting-developments-at-the-AT/">&lt;p&gt;march 29 thru april 6 i was in corbett, oregon, for my css job. we had our big annual 5-day training called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.storybasedstrategy.org/the-advanced-training&quot;&gt;the advanced training&lt;/a&gt; and i was on the staff planning and support team. it was overall an amazing time. here are some photos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvvjga9n6xu/&quot;&gt;of the training and staff team&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv6tZEPHOun/&quot;&gt;of one of the evenings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv1_2BmhIcU/&quot;&gt;of one of the training days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;two things i want to share here though because of the “spiritual” nature of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first, my (new) friend, jess st. louis, found out that a friend was murdered by the police on one of the days of the training. devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[pause]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just want to note that i really really did and do feel the weight of that experience. what i’m about to say next is journaling about my side of the experience, but i hope it doesn’t come off as trivializing the experience of a murder…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[pausing again and taking a deep breath]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what i want to say about that situation was that i followed my intuition lots and it was good. two trainers and i went to jess while she was holding the initial news and in tears. it was in the morning, but eventually, the trainers had to go back to their small groups. it turned out to be &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; great that i wasn’t on the training team. i could stay behind and hold space for jess while the other trainers went back to their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just sat with jess and we breathed and she did a somatic grounding practice (she’s a student of generative somatics) and just held each other’s gaze and it was good. i shared a few thoughts (literally don’t remember what i said… #Spiritwastalking) and gave a few ideas of how she should move forward with the next few hours. before leaving, she said she wanted to check-in with me after her time alone to have me see if she was actually ready to go back to her training group or if she needed more time. i said i could definitely do that. then she went to walk by the water (we were on the columbia river).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i took my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orthodoxpath.org/spiritual-life/comboschini-prayer-rope-part-1/&quot;&gt;comboschini&lt;/a&gt; and walked the labyrinth to do my own grounding. how awesome was it that there was a labyrinth onsite?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in a magical unveiling of some sacred geometry, i found that if i said my mantra (“i am the love of the universe”) per bead, it ended up being me getting to the center of the maze. and then i did the same on the way out. so i got 200 mantras in and by the time i got back inside, jess was looking for me! unreal timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she and i went to go sit on a bench near a hummingbird feeder and overlooking the water. we had a good chat and i felt that she needed a little more time solo before going back. she thought my assessment was totally right and took the time before heading back in to her group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fast forward to the last day of the retreat: on the way out, jess says to me “not only was it helpful, it was an honor to be held and supported by you as i handled that news. thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok, will have to share the second thought another time… i could just write SO much. interesting…&lt;/p&gt;
