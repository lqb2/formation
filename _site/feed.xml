&lt;p&gt;during the closing circle he tony parchment said “i’m so thoroughly impressed by how you present yourself at your age. how old did you say you are? 27? 29? when i was your age, i wasn’t nearly as thoughtful or well-put-together as you are. wow!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the way out of drinks, he says “thanks for facilitating for us. you’re an old, old soul.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commit&lt;/strong&gt;
Say yes to this nine months transformation, supported by deep introspection, self- and community-care, healing/integration, and love. This commitment to my transformation is in support of my own movement towards liberation which, in turn and simultaneously is a necessary driver and element of liberation for our species (and beyond). In order to authentically use my gift / responsibility (supporting transformation), I must have the experience of my own transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice&lt;/strong&gt;
I will remind myself of my commitment by reading it aloud weekly, ideally during Sabbath. 
I will document my process weekly (maybe as a way to break my Sabbath) by writing and taking photos to share with my small group as well as my formation team. 
I will work with tarot daily. 
I will engage in journey work with plant medicine. 
I will meditate daily for 20+ minutes and have at least one 60 minute session per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support and Inspiration&lt;/strong&gt;
I know that this will not be easy. I will remember to return to my commitment when I struggle or want to back out of this work. I will preemptively ask my elder to check in on me every two weeks. I will make sure that my formation small group and team knows my telltale signs of struggle and avoidance: poor time-management, lack of high-quality sleep, and under-communication about what is happening. When I feel overwhelmed, I will scale back to my minimum viable ritual: meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To What End&lt;/strong&gt;
I make this commitment with my whole heart, knowing it may involve unforeseen challenges and disruption to the life I have known. It is worth doing because the gift, the medicine I have is useless unless it is shared. I have seen previous iterations of impact when I am doing my work in the world and now it is time to level up. Why now? The increasingly chaotic world we live in will require everything we have if our species is going to survive. I recognize and accept that the survival our species is not a necessity; species go extinct all the time. ‘Everything we have’ includes what I have and I am ready to step even farther into what that is so that I can play my part in this beautiful, universal love song of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I, Lawrence Barriner II, brother to Laurentius, child of Jacqueline and Lawrence (by blood), grandchild of Ruth (by blood), Martin (by love), William (by blood), Carrie (by love), James (by love), Doretha (by blood) and Henry (by blood), descendent of Gilbert Maynor, born 1813, of Charleston, South Carolina, godfather of Asa, uncle of Jayden, Apollo, Alvie, and Leah, and inspired by the powerful work and lineages of Boston facilitators and healers, queer Christian mystics, theologians, writers, and poets…</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">on beginning formation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/01/06/beginning-formation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="on beginning formation" /><published>2019-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/01/06/beginning-formation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/01/06/beginning-formation/">&lt;p&gt;1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am love: stardust, gravity, matter 
i, matter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am the love of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i know i am because when i say it, i shake 
my skin tingles 
my heart pounds
i want to cover my mouth 
but i remember that i am
and so i do not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because when i remember that i am
power beyond my limits arrives
it was always here
always
but i forgot
forget&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so my work
is to remember&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you? 
when you say it? 
maybe your hands will also shake 
or 
maybe these words 
are not rooted in you
as they are in me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but if you are here
facing yourself (the Universe)
then there are words rooted in you that will make you shake
where are they?
ah, is that their light we see
coming through the seams?
what are they?
let us open them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we/all will know when you have
the ocean has a funny way of finding us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to integrate is to bring the pieces together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after traveling, a trip, a journey
integration is 
bringing from the mountaintop
what we can use in the valley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so we work
in the valley
hoping to return to the highest points
with more than we brought last time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;healing is partnership
with ourselves
with each other
with the Universe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am
you are
we are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let you/me/us
remember&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">1.</summary></entry></feed>
