ANYWAYS enough guilt-based caveats. i’m gonna start writing in 5 minute chunks just to keep this update moving and here goes the first (well i’m already 3 minutes in … yikes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was great. it was different than every other experience i’ve heard of who does this medicine. (sidenote: i heard that everyone’s experience is unique with this medicine and that nothing you’ve heard about it will be your experience. that resonated and also just felt like a universally true statement, haha). the retreat, which i had assumed was heavily focused on the medicine ceremony, was only actually 1/3 (at most) focused on the medicine ceremonies. the bigger picture of the retreat was about developing collective consciousness and practicing listening to it. and even the medicine ceremonies were about the collective (as opposed to the individual). that said, i did have some powerful insights some through in the personal/individual lane, but they were all very background to the collective learnings. powerful stuff and i can definitely imagine doing a more standard, individually focused ceremony with this same maestro again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[writing break after 7 mins]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[begin writing on airplane to SFO]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a huge amount of work happened before i even left boston for the drive to the weekend. i did a shitton of exploration and dancing with fear. i read a lot, observed myself a lot, and had lots of insights. over the weeks leading up to the experience, i started writing down everything i was afraid of. i realized at a certain point that all the fear was actually just a few, recurrent things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after i noticed that, i used the “5 whys” as a framework for exploring each fear. i’d sit with the iceberg tip of each fear and then, over the course of some days, the next layer down of the iceberg would reveal itself. and several weeks in, i’d worked through several of these fear icebergs and that was SO helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for example: (like almost everyone) i found myself grappling with the fear of purging. so i asked myself: &lt;em&gt;why am i so afraid of vomiting?&lt;/em&gt; that lead to the insight that it’s actually that i’m afraid of being out of control. so then i asked: &lt;em&gt;why am i so afraid of being out of control?&lt;/em&gt; and the insight that came was that it’s actually fear about being out of control of my body. so then i asked &lt;em&gt;why am i so afraid of being out of control of my body?&lt;/em&gt; and the next insight was that i’m afraid that if i’m out of control of my body, no one else will know how to take care of it. question: &lt;em&gt;why are you afraid that others won’t be able to take care of your body?&lt;/em&gt; insight: this teacher has sat in the amazon for ten years with this medicine. not only that, but this group of people has been sitting with this medicine together for seven years. what makes you think they, collectively, wouldn’t be able to figure out how to take care of your body? question: &lt;em&gt;so what’s beneath my thought that other folks couldn’t care for my body if i was out of control of it?”&lt;/em&gt; insight: it’s actually that you don’t trust others to take care of you when you’re in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and all that lead to a final conclusion: i need to get clear about my concerns for my body, figure out how to express them to the holders of the space, and then trust and let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all that happened leading up to the experience and that was just ONE of these fear icebergs. there were several others, but i’ll save those so i can keep moving on this shareback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-two-ceremony-nights&quot;&gt;the two ceremony nights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the first night, we all took a lighter than usual dose. and instead of the typical ceremony where the shaman sings icaros to everyone and then 1on1 to individual people, he would start us off with a song and then we’d take turns leading a short verse and then we’d all sing the long chorus before the next person jumped in to lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;coming on had a few indicators that i want to keep note of for the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nausea. i tried to lean towards purging but it wasn’t coming so i stopped trying (though after doing all that work, i felt almost excited to try)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some light visuals. zebra-esque color patterning and some swirling, but nothing too intense or specific&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a surreal experience of time slipping. like, we’d sang a song and i was clear that people to my left and right weren’t singing anymore but i swore i could still hear the song being sung… like my mind was bringing the past into the present&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some dark figures appearing in my eyes-open line of sight. at one point i felt like the people to my right and left were standing up but i was sure they weren’t. at another point, i felt like there were pillars of darkness coming from behind my head down in front of my face… sort of like if i had taken my dreads loose and let them hang down over my face. but i checked several times and they were definitely behind my head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then i felt sure i had “settled in” to the medicine definitely being active in me. honestly, the four hours passed MUCH MUCH faster than i anticipated. it all felt lovely in a very surprising way. i was practicing the mantra that i’d been gifted that monday evening before by tawna and had been writing on my hands since: “deep breaths, small steps.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/J60VrCW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;deep breaths&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/U2ve0oH.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just continued to take deep breaths and know that each second passing is/was a small step forward into the unknown nature of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we sang 3 or 4 or 5 more songs in the same style. only one person purged and they purged a LOT, every time we all collectively sang, in fact. there was a fascinating story from them the next day about why they think they’d purged at those moments, but that’s not my story to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eventually, the shaman said it felt like the ceremony was closing and everyone agreed so we came to a close, relit candles (did i mention the room was in total darkness after everyone had taken the medicine?) and had a closing conversation before some folks started to trickle out to get food and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insights&quot;&gt;insights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as many of you know who have experienced medicine work like this, there are insights that come through during the space and then they evolve/land as time passes outside of the space. i like the framing of calling that “integration.” so here are some insights that came through live along with some of how they’ve each landed in my waking life. as i look back at them, in some ways they’re not particularly new or profound… (there is nothing new under the sun) but what’s profound about them is how embodied they are now for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for a time, i kept playing this eye game where i was looking up at the skylight in the yurt and crossing my eyes to make the opening appear like two openings. the insight there is that &lt;strong&gt;it really IS about how you look at things that determines what you see&lt;/strong&gt;. if i cross my eyes, my brain fully processes the one opening as two (and notably, two eyes that were then looking back at me). and if i relaxed my eyes, i only saw one. the role of literal vision itself is critical in determining how and what i see in the world around me. not only that, but (a) it’s more effect to see multiple than to see the oneness (once you learn that) and (b) i don’t have to do that much work to switch from one lane to another. it’s still real effort, but it’s less than it could be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sometimes when individuals joined in to sing, their voices weren’t very strong. for some of the voices, they felt so weak that it made me deeply sad. i longed for their voices to be full and sonorous. i vowed to, the next day, propose that we do some collective singing to strengthen people’s access to their voices. the next day, talking with one of the other participants, i learned that the medicine often hinders access to your voice. so the fact that i had full access to my voice was a rarity. and the fact that i almost offered an intervention that had nothing to do with reality was stunning. the learning: it’s very possible to prescribe a solution to the WRONG problem if my analysis is wrong. &lt;strong&gt;the insight: the best way to proceed in life is to listen with compassion and offer a solution or idea if asked or prompted&lt;/strong&gt;. in a way, this makes life &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much easier to live. it makes space for a lot more being and dwindles the need for so much doing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as soon as we sat down, even before we took the medicine, i noticed i had to pee. but as soon as the maestro said that it’s the best if we stay inside the ceremony space, i started to resist going to pee. i had the sensation of having to pee for the whole time. it ebbed and flowed and i worked deeply with one of the pieces of advice given by one of the medicine people: “when given sensation that feels unpleasant, ask for the experience to be transformed.” eventually, i felt like i couldn’t hold it anymore so i got up, put my jacket on, got my shoes on and asked my teacher for support getting out to the bathroom. i took the step (a big step for me) of, when he asked if i would be ok on my own responding that i wanted support (even though i knew deep down that i probably could have made it on my own). and as soon as he said yes, the maestro said that it was time for the ceremony to come to a close. ARGHASLDJFALSDKJF!!! i went back to sit down and then we had another 30+ minutes of closing before i could actually get up to go pee. my fear of being seen as someone who had to get up and leave the ceremony space kept me from getting my needs met. &lt;strong&gt;the insight: fear of being fully seen, in sometimes surprising ways, prevents me from getting all my needs met.&lt;/strong&gt; – the cool thing was that i applied the lesson the next day in the middle of the sweat lodge and it felt like a huge breakthrough! now, tbc, i have no problem with letting ppl know i have to pee, in general. but the insight about the relationship between being seen and getting my full needs met was worth the experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i totally totally psyched myself up/out for this experience. hour after hour, it became clear that thigns weren’t going to be nearly as bad as i had made them out to be. now, on one hand, there’s part of me that is grateful for my capacity to imagine many bad scenarios. it often means that when things go better than expected, i get wonderful feelings of relief and joy, instead of disappointment that things were worse than anticipated. that said, i am beginning to wonder about the amount of energy i spend doing that negative scenario planning and what else it might be used for if i let go of that imagining. (sidenote: one thing i read leading up to the retreat was that fear is only possible when you hold on to the illusion of control. fear comes when you worry about the outcome of something, which is linked to ideas of how that thing should go. when you release the belief that you can control outcomes, all there is to do is push, let go, and be curious.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’ve been writing this for about an hour so i’m going to wind this down. i think i’m going to be excited to have this level of detail later but right now i need to go do some work and get back to people with things i owe them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i feel excited to have learned that fear can be moved through with deep breaths and presence. i love that my capacity to see the oneness in all things has taken a huge leap. i love these mantras that i’ll work with in the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;push and let go&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;let go and be curious&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;listen with compassion, offer when asked&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;life is a deep, resounding yes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deep breaths, small steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aries&quot;&gt;Aries&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;basic personality &amp;amp; ego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new moon, I tap into my determination. It is always there as a resource for me to draw upon, but now I put it front and center as a practice. What I do on repeat plays the tune I create my life to. My rituals create worlds of meaning or disappointment. Mayhem or joyful chaos. Much ado about nothing or a lot of that special something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I routinely sharpen what is in my toolshed. By flipping, reversing, and reconstructing the outdated structures I have been handed to work within, I make a triumph out of what was too tired to be of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make sure that my instruments are cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to create a career in honor of mediocrity. With this new moon, I honor my unique way of using what I have in my professional grasp, when and where I can. Doing so requires effort as much as rest. It requires planning as much as it does dreaming. It requires me to develop my talents as much as it requires me to play without needing to produce. I focus on staying on track as much as I allow myself pathways to get lost down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aquarius-rising&quot;&gt;Aquarius Rising&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how others experience me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no succeeding if I’m unwilling to work with the entirety of my experience. Particles of my past regularly intertwine with the events of the moment, but being able to parse out one from the other is what makes deconstructing demons possible. Pretending I am above my burdens only forces me to remove myself from life. Beauty doesn’t always showcase the process it takes to get there, but I’m here for the whole of my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my job to dissect what derails me. It’s my job to know the difference between what is dangerous and what feels threatening but will ultimately leave me thriving. It’s my job to find the people and the practices that help me live a life with less self-condemnation, doubt, and devaluing of my gifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new moon, I sort through what is a phantom of my past and what is the promise of a noteworthy future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s never fun to face a fear, but it’s the only way to ground and grow. It’s the only way to truly get to know who I am. It’s the only way to get to the gold that lays in wait underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;virgo&quot;&gt;Virgo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;moon: inner self &amp;amp; deepest emotions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d rather live my life in pursuit of joy, justice, and connection than spend my precious energy convincing others that I’m right. I know that what I’m right about will reveal itself. I don’t have to push truth on anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m present, the need to prove anything vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trust that everything I do in earnest is revealed eventually. I focus on directing my energy towards what works right now. I focus on channeling my creativity into projects that help me regenerate. I focus on my rebirth this Virgo Season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trust that what I need will find its way to me, what is mine will never refuse me, and what is happening at this moment is needed and necessary. I trust that the relationship dynamics in my life are helping me hone in on a couple of key lessons I need to learn now. I trust in love’s medicine. Its healing process uncovers my fears, my fortunes, and my everything in-between. I am here for the whole unveiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chiron description from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cafeastrology.com/chiron.html&quot;&gt;cafe astrology&lt;/a&gt;. shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pay attention to what my intuition is telling me. I thank it for the messages it sends. I track its ability to always guide me to where I need to go next. I’m all for making plans, but I’ll break them if and when my gut demands I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new moon, I make a note of the books that magically fall off my shelves, the teachers that I accidentally stumble into, and the emails that come at exactly the right moment. I know that each time I acknowledge the synchronicities of my life, I reclaim a little bit of my power. Being overly invested in only the physical realm dulls my senses and intuitive powers. When I forget my connection to the living world, the most intense self-criticism my mind can cook up has a chance to take hold of my spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new moon, I thoroughly investigate all the murmurs in my mind that suggest I am losing, lost, or failing at life. There are too many systems that win when I entertain self-doubt. There are too many other possibilities and potentials at play that I can and will tap into instead. There will be moments when I forget this, but they will pale in comparison to the moments when I recall my power. With the new moon, I commit this to memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">source: https://chaninicholas.com/horoscopes-for-the-new-moon-in-leo-2019/</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">songs and ritual memories</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/08/22/emet/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="songs and ritual memories" /><published>2019-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/08/22/emet</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/08/22/emet/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;goodbye-song&quot;&gt;goodbye song&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;bridge 3: discernment meeting (using the quaker clearness committee practice) based on the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What is the area of my life I am drawn toward greater connection to the sacred&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Who am I being called to be in this area&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What gets in the way&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;over the past few weeks, i’ve been digging in (not as much as i wanted to, but still a good bit) and really seeing that i’ve done quite a lot. in order to get to sharing about the committee meeting, i’ll skip some of those insights for now, but there’s some good stuff in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when i got down to answering the above questions, here’s what i came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the area of my life I am drawn toward greater connection to the sacred&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;men’s healing work, with a focus on queer men of color but not exclusively&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;being grounded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who am I being called to be in this area&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a healer and a facilitator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What gets in the way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Needing money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What steps might I take to move through obstacles into a new way of being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moving towards a living situation and financial setup that allow me to do more healing work without needing to ask people for money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i came to the end of filling in the questions, all sorts of doubts arose. “maybe i’m making up all these answers just to finish the assignments. maybe there’s something deeper, something beneath all these answers, something i should really be digging in towards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- then a few things happened: 

1. eroc gave me a call a few hours before the meeting and gave me lots of really beautiful feedback about what he's seen in me since this process began. it affirmed lots of the answers i'd written up 
2. luana called and left a magical, affirming voicemail.  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so when the time for my committee meeting came, i brought in all those answers and the doubts, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i won’t recount the whole call, but essentially the following insights are my takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;instead of holding my doubts as “is this made up vs is this true/not made up,” what if i held the frame that &lt;em&gt;everything is made up because reality is based on our perception&lt;/em&gt;. in that case, if the answers i “made up” are that i am being called to men’s healing work… then that’s as real as anything else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what i’m being called to in this moment may not be the same thing i feel called towards later. i can make that decision when it arises (but it’s actually not possible to make that choice before the choice point arrives).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(eroc also said this) one of the authentic/integral parts of my healing work for others is that it is almost always rooted in what i need for myself. this is part of how i stay balanced in my “giving” and “receiving.” this is a critical balance to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two things in particular get me most excited about men’s (healing) work:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;men hugging each other (like for real holding each other)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;men who are closeted being able to come further and further into themselves and out of shame/fear.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i love working in/with groups, though 1:1 is where my eyes light up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;my aries energy, the energy of the initiator is very very real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO! that’s that for now. thanks, again, yall for supporting me and i’m excited to see what the final 2 months of this program hold. it looks like my group’s last official call is oct 27. what a ride it’s been. and when it ends, i know it’ll still just be a new beginning…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">so this past sunday was my clearness committee meeting. the prep work was three stages/bridges:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a story about the impact of libations</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/08/13/libations-in-july/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a story about the impact of libations" /><published>2019-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/08/13/libations-in-july</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/08/13/libations-in-july/">&lt;p&gt;a few weeks ago, luana (w/ me on assist) opened a meeting with some ritual work. lu invited me in to lead libations while she rang her bell. it happened and felt good, but the real thing i wanted to write about is this: kathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;two things happened for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first, she shared with us that during the libations sections where i was pouring for future ancestors, the baby kicked. and then kicked during every other mention of ancestors but didn’t kick during any other sections! #shook&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;second, she shared that the part of the libations where i called in visions and dreams of the future had a supercharged impact later. that night she had a dream where a friend of hers (a friend who died of cancer two months ago) wanted her to tell his widow that she should “not be afraid to let her light shine a little brighter.” that next morning, that friend popped up in kathy’s IG feed and kathy relayed the message and it was received really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;obviously this was lu and me (and all the ancestors and elements and universe) together but still pretty wild for me to be a part of something like that. phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aries&quot;&gt;Aries&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;basic personality &amp;amp; ego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the best of my ability, I make room for joy. I defend my right to it. I guard it against being overtaken with the many distractions of the world. I know that being able to be playful is a privilege – one that fear, insecurity, and sorrow swallow when given the chance. There have been many times, a million moments, where I couldn’t access what felt good. When I’ve had to spend all of my energy surviving. When I was worn out by just trying to get through the day. Whatever distance I have from pain, I promise to pursue what brings me healing so that I have more space for hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One moment of pleasure can rewire my entire system, so I treat it as my most sacred of medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new moon, I plant the seeds for future joy to spring forth. I clear what clutters my path to it. I make no exceptions for those that say one thing and do another. I have no patience for anyone that takes what they want from me but offers little to nothing in return. I make sure that I don’t follow those that lead with only their needs in mind. With this new moon, I recommit to my growth through the most enjoyable avenues available. With this new moon, I remember that my prosperity is made more bountiful when shared with the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aquarius-rising&quot;&gt;Aquarius Rising&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how others experience me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every moment of intimacy I experience burns away a layer of what prevents me from feeling lovable. Any lies about my worthiness that I have picked up, made up, or bought into can be dispelled by a sincere act of kindness. Disrupted by direct transmission of care. Derailed by an act of generosity towards me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make sure to receive them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new moon highlights the relationships in my life that are abundant in their ability to know that love is its own reward. There is nothing to get from each other, just experiences to give and receive. There is nothing to demand of one another when boundaries are respected and beauty is honored. There is nothing to push anyone else towards when I am as firm as I need to be with what is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no fear that those that share what I find sacred will find me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new moon, I remember the power of enjoying the company I keep. I surround myself with those that want to place mutual pleasure side by side with respect and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;virgo&quot;&gt;Virgo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;moon: inner self &amp;amp; deepest emotions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I break for joy. I stop when it’s been too long since my body felt loved, replenished, and rested. I pause for all things that help me live my best life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all that I give, offer, and make myself available to, I am allowed to receive, accept, and let myself be. With this new moon, I take some of my best advice. I remember all of the love I have put on others and I put the same on myself. I recall the energy I have spent on building my outer life and reinvest it in doing some inner maintenance. I know how important it is to reconnect with myself through the potent activity of not giving AF while not doing AFing thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am worthy of a reset. I am worth resting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new moon, I remember my inherent value. Separate from my production schedule. Separate from my bank account. Separate from what I can do for others. With this new moon, I focus on valuing my free-time, my natural state of being, and all my rituals for restoration and renewal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chiron description from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cafeastrology.com/chiron.html&quot;&gt;cafe astrology&lt;/a&gt;. shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I magnetize the materials I need to build my dreams. I cleanse my mind of toxic ideas about amassing wealth for my gain alone. I clear my heart of the misconceptions that I need to cling to, hold on to, or hoard attention and societal recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that the more I share, the more I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make space for what is honestly abundant in my life. Cheap renditions of affluence are no match for the power of generosity. I know that I have been gifted with a bank of goodwill and I plan on spending every cent of it before I leave this earth. I know that I have been given every tool I could ever need and I plan on putting them to the best use. I know that if I don’t focus on innovating how I do my work, I won’t feel alive when I do it. In order to experience abundance, I have to know what things in life can be risked abundantly. My pride, my ego, and any feelings of superiority I may harbor can all be risked, disrupted, and interrupted for a greater wealth to illuminate my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I willingly dismantle any false beliefs that tell me I need to be greedy in order to be wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">source: https://chaninicholas.com/horoscopes-for-the-new-moon-in-leo-2019/</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">some quick thoughts on liberation and self-care</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/07/30/thoughts-on-liberation-and-self-care/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="some quick thoughts on liberation and self-care" /><published>2019-07-30T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/07/30/thoughts-on-liberation-and-self-care</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/07/30/thoughts-on-liberation-and-self-care/">&lt;p&gt;a few quick quotes and thoughts i’m having while reading &lt;em&gt;my grandmother’s hands&lt;/em&gt; by resmaa menakem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a calm, settled body is the foundation for health, for healing, for helping others, and for changing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a settled body can help other bodies to settle themselves. an unsettled body can push other bodies to be unsettled. (briefer version: a settled body can settle other bodies. an unsettled body can unsettle other bodies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because of these two things, i’m now thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;caring for myself is not an option. it is foundational. i cannot heal myself or others without knowing how to settle (and activate) my body. i cannot do what is needed without a settled body.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;liberation is not “over there” or “coming up soon.” it is in moments and experiences. liberation, like life, is in the body (ht &lt;a href=&quot;http://infinitegrowth.rocks/blog/2019/3/2/life-is-in-the-body&quot;&gt;dcc&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;harriet tubman said “my people are free.” she knew it and saw it and worked to make it so. i know of people in chains and personally know people in prisons who are free. freedom is joy without fear. therefore, contrary to lots of dominant rhetoric, i do not believe “none of us are free until all of us are free.” i believe that when one surpasses fear of death, you can be free while staring down the barrel of a gun. i believe this is how harriet and ancestors who drowned themselves instead of being enslaved and jesus and buddha and people with kids who quit their jobs without knowing what’s next are all free in the same way.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;soooooooo this isn’t clean language yet but i believe that “those of us who are free love freedom so much that we will risk it to help others experience it.” and like harriet, that might mean slipping back into the territory of the unfree and leading others to freedom. this is both literal and physical and also a metaphor.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;patriarchy is particularly insidious because it (a) disconnects men (via traumatic experiences usually dealt by male friends and parents of all genders) from their bodies or sometimes even rewrites the helpful stance “i am settled, therefore i should move forward” into “i am unsettled, therefore i should move forward” (insert death-defying behaviors) and “i have no idea whether i’m settled or not, but i should do this thing anyways.” and (b) rewards people (see the cishet white wealthy risk-taking ceo and start-up founder and angel investor) who have done the most rewiring.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on monday july 22, a different friend &lt;!-- margie dillenburg --&gt; emailed me and said ‘You are perfect and right on time.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok ok i get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: 30 july 2019 — and now dcc has added “you are the perfect human.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">so something someone said to me while during evolutionary relationships 1 was “you are the perfect thing! you are exactly what i need right now!”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">formation phase 3</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/07/18/entering-phase-3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="formation phase 3" /><published>2019-07-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/07/18/entering-phase-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/07/18/entering-phase-3/">&lt;p&gt;we’re moving into the final phase of formation: it was originally called ‘beyond’ (following phase 1: inner, and phase 2: outer). now it’s called ‘inner-outer’ which is profounding confusing. but &amp;amp;shrug;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one of the first prompts we’re being called to is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Make time over the coming days to take stock of where you have been. Revisit your materials from the Discernment Period. What stands out now from the Healing Action Plan? What did you learn from reflecting on formation? From your conversations with your people? What did you say Yes to in January, and how has that played out? Start to notice threads running through your experience since then. Start to listen for an area you’re called toward in your life.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i’ve started to do even a tiny bit of that reflection, so much is opening up! thoughts i’ve had so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what have i learned on reflection on formation so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WOW! when i think about current me compared to oct 2018 me, so much has changed. &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in that funny non-dual way, so much is the same. but when i think about what i’m doing with my time, many things are different.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i’m so much better now at spending time solo. it’s clear now, beause of practice, why that time matters so much. it’s not selfish… it’s energizing to me and, by the transitive property, energizing for my community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i am holding spiritual circles now like… all over the place.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the line between spiritual and non-spiritual circle is much blurrier than it was before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what have i learned from conversations with my people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having things i say said back to me is a huge way that i learn. luana did this first with the poem i wrote in response to one of the first prompts we got in the program. and danielle has done it to me most recently and in a way that totally blew my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what i haven’t done but still want to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;heal wounds related to blackness (emotional emancipation group didn’t happen)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;transform relationship with dad (maybe do decolonizing christianity book club)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explore gullah geechee ancestry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;explore other african ancestry and spiritual traditions (mali: dogon, root work)&lt;/li&gt;
