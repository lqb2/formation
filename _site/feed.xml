&lt;p&gt;part 2! the second thought is about the 2nd half of the training. i’m going to keep it short so that i’m not late for my call in 3 mins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i had a few agenda sections during the week, mostly 5 or fewer minutes long. each of them was to talk about my role as network engagement coordinator and to discuss network weaving vs networking. each time i got up in front of the room, the reception was pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on wednesday, one of the co-directors asked me if i would be willing to take on and lead with an activity a big chunk of the friday agenda. i waffled but said yes a few hours later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then on thursday, she asked if i would be willing to &lt;em&gt;close the entire gathering!&lt;/em&gt; i was like… you mean instead of you or the other co-director or our other colleague who has been to SIX of these trainings? she said “yup. it seems like people are craving a bit more spirituality. that seems like what you’re bringing and me and [other co-director] aren’t really feeling like we can bring that…. so think about it. get back to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i thought about it and was definitely hesitant for all the usual reasons…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;why me?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what if i mess it up?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i’m the only man present on staff at the training… that feels weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the biggest questions of all: what if i actually do a good job? what if this was the way it was meant to happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after sleeping on it, i said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thankfully, the closing activity was already decided (it was one that was from a previuos year); i just had to lead it. but i did it and i &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it was good. there was definitely an awkward moment or two, but it was definitely definitely progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a few other notes from the week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;my nervousness of speaking in front of groups has diminished substantially this past year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing out my talking points is a good practice for me. and even if i don’t look at them as i’m speaking, the process of distilling my whole shpeel into bulles really helps me remember them when i’m up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when i speak about things i actually know about, it’s easy to talk and even ramble. when i’m less familiar or less comfy, things get weird, heh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok! that’s all for now! thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">back to part 1</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">surprising developments at the A.T.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/04/12/interesting-developments-at-the-AT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="surprising developments at the A.T." /><published>2019-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/04/12/interesting-developments-at-the-AT</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/04/12/interesting-developments-at-the-AT/">&lt;p&gt;march 29 thru april 6 i was in corbett, oregon, for my css job. we had our big annual 5-day training called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.storybasedstrategy.org/the-advanced-training&quot;&gt;the advanced training&lt;/a&gt; and i was on the staff planning and support team. it was overall an amazing time. here are some photos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvvjga9n6xu/&quot;&gt;of the training and staff team&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv6tZEPHOun/&quot;&gt;of one of the evenings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv1_2BmhIcU/&quot;&gt;of one of the training days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;two things i want to share here though because of the “spiritual” nature of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first, my (new) friend, jess st. louis, found out that a friend was murdered by the police on one of the days of the training. devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[pause]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just want to note that i really really did and do feel the weight of that experience. what i’m about to say next is journaling about my side of the experience, but i hope it doesn’t come off as trivializing the experience of a murder…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[pausing again and taking a deep breath]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what i want to say about that situation was that i followed my intuition lots and it was good. two trainers and i went to jess while she was holding the initial news and in tears. it was in the morning, but eventually, the trainers had to go back to their small groups. it turned out to be &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; great that i wasn’t on the training team. i could stay behind and hold space for jess while the other trainers went back to their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just sat with jess and we breathed and she did a somatic grounding practice (she’s a student of generative somatics) and just held each other’s gaze and it was good. i shared a few thoughts (literally don’t remember what i said… #Spiritwastalking) and gave a few ideas of how she should move forward with the next few hours. before leaving, she said she wanted to check-in with me after her time alone to have me see if she was actually ready to go back to her training group or if she needed more time. i said i could definitely do that. then she went to walk by the water (we were on the columbia river).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i took my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orthodoxpath.org/spiritual-life/comboschini-prayer-rope-part-1/&quot;&gt;comboschini&lt;/a&gt; and walked the labyrinth to do my own grounding. how awesome was it that there was a labyrinth onsite?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in a magical unveiling of some sacred geometry, i found that if i said my mantra (“i am the love of the universe”) per bead, it ended up being me getting to the center of the maze. and then i did the same on the way out. so i got 200 mantras in and by the time i got back inside, jess was looking for me! unreal timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she and i went to go sit on a bench near a hummingbird feeder and overlooking the water. we had a good chat and i felt that she needed a little more time solo before going back. she thought my assessment was totally right and took the time before heading back in to her group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fast forward to the last day of the retreat: on the way out, jess says to me “not only was it helpful, it was an honor to be held and supported by you as i handled that news. thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ok, will have to share the second thought another time… i could just write SO much. interesting…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/formation/general/2019/04/14/interesting-developments-at-the-AT-2/&quot;&gt;see part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">march 29 thru april 6 i was in corbett, oregon, for my css job. we had our big annual 5-day training called the advanced training and i was on the staff planning and support team. it was overall an amazing time. here are some photos of the training and staff team, of one of the evenings, and of one of the training days.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">journey 1 - crystalized worldviews</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/journey/2019/03/27/journey-crystalized-worldviews/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="journey 1 - crystalized worldviews" /><published>2019-03-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-03-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/journey/2019/03/27/journey-crystalized-worldviews</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/journey/2019/03/27/journey-crystalized-worldviews/">&lt;p&gt;so. one thing: i think i am releasing the commitment to adding more to that previous journey post. it’s causing me more weight and angst than i think is necessary. i’ll add more to it if i feel it but i’m not committed to it anymore. i am learning, practicing how to release old commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here’s another thought, though, from that same journey. it mostly came through conversation with some of yall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a narrative i have around the medicine work i’ve done so far is that these particular medicines connect my brain to more of itself. so in that state, my brain is making connections across wider “gaps” and faster than in regular state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and as the medicines work their way through my system, the links close back down and the connection-making slows and narrows again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but every time, it doesn’t slow down to what i perceived the pace was before. and i had the thought during one of the days immediately following the journey “what if the rate of making connections between things is permanently increased because of this work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then a chat with danielle essentially verified that and i was like :O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that is both terrifying and awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why? well, here’s another story from the experience. i mentioned it briefly and early in that other post, but here’s a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one thing my guide said to us was that the medicine brings you the lessons you need to learn. it meets you right where you are. too fucking true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so this was my first journey where i expected to have visuals. and as the medicine was working its way in, i was looking all around the room for them. at candles, at faces, at lights, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after our guide came over and checked in on me, i noticed my heart racing. i had some curiosity about that and thought “well, since i’m not seeing anything, at least i can tune into my body like i do when i meditate.” and i thought that that usually happens easier when my eyes are closed. so i close my eyes to tune in more and then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAM! visuals. shapes floating around and rainbows and shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of course, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the lesson: stop looking outside of yourself for the interesting stuff. it’s all happening inside you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so that’s the process that these particular medicines put me through. they make a way i’m viewing the world VERY literal and then once i see it, i can topple it and move on to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this happens like 50 times over the course of the evening. which is wild!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so, to my earlier thought, if that starts happening faster and faster over time in my life outside of journey space… well, damn. lol.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">so. one thing: i think i am releasing the commitment to adding more to that previous journey post. it’s causing me more weight and angst than i think is necessary. i’ll add more to it if i feel it but i’m not committed to it anymore. i am learning, practicing how to release old commitments.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">journey 1 - breadcrumbs</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/journey/2019/03/16/journey-breadcrumbs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="journey 1 - breadcrumbs" /><published>2019-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/journey/2019/03/16/journey-breadcrumbs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/journey/2019/03/16/journey-breadcrumbs/">&lt;p&gt;so first thing to share: &lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2.co/blog///2019/03/13/breadcrumbs/&quot;&gt;this post about breadcrumbs on my regular blog&lt;/a&gt; is 100% a journey experience. that is the headline takeaway from this journey: only breadcrumbs can be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that leads to three actions for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find the breadcrumbs of my ancestors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make and eat this lifetime here and now (since i can’t leave it behind)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leave breadcrumbs for my descendants (bio and/or chosen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some other thoughts about the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what is so magical to me about the combination of these particular medicines (let’s call one ‘heart’ and the other ‘forest’) is that they make my worldviews and limiting beliefs LITERAL and then, once i can see them, i usually get the chance to break through them. this happens in regular life too, but so much more slowly. it happens in journeyspace like every few minutes (if not faster).
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;and in some ways, this is exhausting. i know the medicines have physical explanations as to why we feel tired or sore after moving them through our systems, but this rapid worldview shifting feels like the psychic facet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so much can happen while the medicines are in me &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; what happens with those insights is continually expanded afterwards. after sleeping and waking up for integration, the discussion and thoughts from others who were in the space can flip, rotate, explode, or widen what i had previously thought the insight was. and as i have begun to integrate some of the thoughts and insights into my life this past week, i talk to people about them and they take on even more meaning/layers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i wrote a TON during the early chunk of the journey when the medicine was coming on. i have never had the desire to write anything before in ceremony so i’m not sure what changed this time. more forest medicine? the small setting (1 guide, 1 co-journeymate)? the context? who knows…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, here’s a rundown of the breadcrumbs i left myself (know that this is probably 1/3 or less of what happened). things in brackets are descriptions of context. the breadcrumbs are in present tense (they’re only slightly edited version of what i actually wrote):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thought-flow-1&quot;&gt;thought flow 1:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[i started the journey laying down with my frog in my left hand, his stick in my right hand, one of my sweetgrass baskets on my belly and a polaroid of me holding my godson, asa shortly after his birth.] i don’t have visuals! of queer, christian fatherhood. does this mean i’m supposed to be a model of that? not committing to that now but noticing…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oh wait, maybe i do have models of that… they’re called monks. i just don’t want that model. i want more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;but on that tip… what does it look like to give birth to a soul? (note to self: talk to luana about this)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;look into baptism as a practice (also eroc baptized me on cortes island)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i’ve been getting a lot of signals about my throat chakra lately but in this moment i think what’s coming up for me is that the blockage i need to clear isn’t mine… it’s my dad’s! maybe &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; is my closest model of queer christian fatherhood. holy shit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;actually, so maybe the modeling that’s needed is queer, christian, black fatherhood?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;need to have some gentle/hard convos with my dad about all those “friends” of his we used to visit&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;also i think part of my own history of sexual abuse happened while we were visiting “friends” or family and i spent lots of time in my male “cousins” bedrooms playing video games and… why are there gaps in my memory here? this is either just forgetting or sexual trauma. gotta go there someday but not today.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aries&quot;&gt;Aries&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;basic personality &amp;amp; ego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memories, and the emotions attached to them bring information that I never refuse. &lt;strong&gt;Timing is everything and any part of my past that is being recovered right now is worth investigating.&lt;/strong&gt;  Even briefly. &lt;strong&gt;I know not to hang on to what is moving through me, but I also know not to resist the current.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am both the container for my experience and the witness of how it pours forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like water overflowing, I allow my imagination to play with the possibilities of what it looks like to live into, through, and beyond the stories of my life.&lt;/strong&gt; To survive is to defy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I allow to define me is my choice, my point of power, and my right to change when and where I need to. With this new moon I am reminded to take note of what I am calling myself, how I am referring to myself, and what that infers to myself. I am here for my liberation, and &lt;em&gt;anything that needs to be released on the way to my personal freedom must be given back to its owner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within the incubators that house my creative energy I give myself permission to regenerate. Here I reclaim myself, rename myself if need be, and remember that I am always becoming&lt;/strong&gt;, undefined by what has happened to me or hasn’t happened for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aquarius-rising&quot;&gt;Aquarius Rising&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how others experience me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is mine to work with has always been and will always be.  I need not fight it, push it, or feel like someone else can take it from me. My resources may take their own time to develop, but they deserve every second they need to take shape. I trust that when the tide ebbs it will flow again. I trust that the projects that wash up on shore are gifts for me to develop. I know that anything that gets lost at sea need not concern me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am here to work on what is in front of me.&lt;/strong&gt; No fantasy. Just the reality of working towards my dreams with every solid, grounded,  effort I can make. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I no longer place my talent, time, and resources into containers too leaky to hold them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Ideas without action aren’t failures, they are foolish to focus on. If I want it, I work towards it. Inwardly and outwardly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m healing my relationship to my financial life no matter the damage, drain, or despair that I’ve experienced because of it. I am not at the whim of my livelihood, but the curator in relationship with it and all it might be able to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;virgo&quot;&gt;Virgo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;moon: inner self &amp;amp; deepest emotions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am made stronger by every moment of vulnerability I have allowed myself.&lt;/strong&gt; Even when I’m met with less warmth than I’d hoped from others, I’m still fortified by my own efforts. &lt;strong&gt;Being honest in front of others takes courage.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I am willing to look like a human who makes both mistakes and as many attempts to get it right as it requires. I am willing to be humbled by all that I still need to learn.&lt;/strong&gt; I am willing to be misunderstood on the way to being known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in no rush to be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My relationships require me to learn how to be open to my own experience when I’d rather shut down, shut you out, or shut the door completely. &lt;em&gt;When I am able to hang out in the moments of wanting to do so, without actually doing so, I know that growth is occurring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I know that change is possible. I know that from this place all the information I need becomes available to me. &lt;strong&gt;With much change on the horizon, I know that developing the skills to sit with what’s uncertain and uncomfortable is more than useful, it’s the most reliable compass I’ll ever have contact with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chiron description from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cafeastrology.com/chiron.html&quot;&gt;cafe astrology&lt;/a&gt;. shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I honor the editing process that I am in. Like weeding an overgrown garden, I remove what is unhelpful in order to bring out the beauty naturally present.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I work with this new moon to clear what clutters my path.&lt;/strong&gt; Doubts that have no sense need to be dumped. Fears that have no foundation need to be exposed as the frauds that they are.  &lt;strong&gt;Shame that no longer serves a purpose needs to be shown the door. This clearing is mine to do. It can’t be shopped out, left for another, or put off.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This helps me take responsibility for the direction I am heading in, but it also helps me feel empowered in the process of doing so. The more I own my desire to head in the direction of my dreams, the less likely I am to resent the work necessary to get there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this new moon I claim the path that I am on&lt;/strong&gt;, all that it asks of me, and all that it asks me to give up, miss out on, or forgo for it. I am crystal clear about the price and that the payoff is to merely be in this process with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I use this Mercury retrograde to review my strategies, maps, and ways of getting from point A to B, making sure that they leave me open to get all the way to Z.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-pisces-march-2019/</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">tarot synchronicity as i prepare for journey work</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/03/04/tarot-synchronicity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="tarot synchronicity as i prepare for journey work" /><published>2019-03-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/03/04/tarot-synchronicity</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/03/04/tarot-synchronicity/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hcUTLxs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last week, on feb 27 i pulled the sun. on feb 28, i pulled the king of swords reversed. on march 1, i pulled them both. well, the sun fell out while i was shuffling and i pulled the king of swords reversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;clearly this is a message i need to hear: the sun’s light turned inward to my own truth. i have been doing lots of intention setting and prep for my march 10 medicine journey work and i think this is a signal for that. so excited!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">resources about loneliness</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/03/01/loneliness/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="resources about loneliness" /><published>2019-03-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/03/01/loneliness</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/03/01/loneliness/">&lt;p&gt;i’m collecting articles and resources on loneliness for two friends. my thinking: loneliness IS part of the human experience. by looking at it and becoming friends with it and its unavoidability, we tap into the reality that we are deeply unalone because we are part of the universe. but i’m looking for ways to help share that with friends who don’t see that yet or that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Mysticism and revolution are two aspects of the same attempt to bring about radical change. Mystics cannot prevent themselves from becoming social critics, since in self-reflection they will discover the roots of a sick society. Similarly, revolutionaries cannot avoid facing their own human condition, since in the midst of their struggle for a new world they will find that they are also fighting their own reactionary fears and false ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When we wonder why the language of tradition Christianity has lost its liberation power for nuclear man, we have to realize that most Christian preaching is still based on the presupposition that man sees himself as meaningfully integrated with a history in which God came to us in the past, is living under us in the present, and will come to liberate us in the future. But when man’s historical consciousness is broken, the whole Christian message seems like a lecture about the great pioneers to a boy on an acid trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and the next paragraph of the above quote)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But how can we avoid this danger? I think by no other way than to enter ourselves first of all into the center of our existence and become familiar with the complexities of our inner lives. As soon as we feel at home in our own house, discover the dark corners as well as the light spots, the closed doors as well as the drafty roos, our confusion will evaporate, our anxiety will diminish, and we will become capable of creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i love that one because it’s my new definition and purpose for doing shadow work (which i’ve been talking to some of yall about). i’m adding these words to words already in my mind/heart that two of yall have shared with me. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But just as bread given without love can bring war instead of peace, professionalism without compassion will turn forgiveness into a gimmick, and the kingdon to come into a blindfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the other day i was sitting in the barbershop texting kendra. we were talking about scheduling a phone call and i was being all sorts of weird about it. i realized this in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she asked me for some dates that worked during a particular week. i responded with a message about being out of town for three days that week. then the below conversation ensued…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aZoqaud.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i worked through my own stuff, kendra saw that last message from me and then said something that literally rocked my world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JMHgjkZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i teared up right then and there in the barbershop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i didn’t realize how tightly i hold onto my fear of disappointing other people!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;kendra and i texted some more and she said (paraphrased) “given what you said, i could feel that you needed to hear that from me. don’t ever worry about disappointing me, and especially not when you’re taking space to do what you need to do for yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ho. lee. shit. i am leveled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gonna be sitting with this for some days/weeks/months. how many situations in my life are shaped by this belief of mine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i will shift it in time, but for now, just noticing and reflecting… wow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">story.</summary></entry></feed>
