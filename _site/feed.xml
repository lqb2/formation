&lt;p&gt;here’s another thought, though, from that same journey. it mostly came through conversation with some of yall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a narrative i have around the medicine work i’ve done so far is that these particular medicines connect my brain to more of itself. so in that state, my brain is making connections across wider “gaps” and faster than in regular state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and as the medicines work their way through my system, the links close back down and the connection-making slows and narrows again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but every time, it doesn’t slow down to what i perceived the pace was before. and i had the thought during one of the days immediately following the journey “what if the rate of making connections between things is permanently increased because of this work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then a chat with danielle essentially verified that and i was like :O&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that is both terrifying and awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why? well, here’s another story from the experience. i mentioned it briefly and early in that other post, but here’s a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one thing my guide said to us was that the medicine brings you the lessons you need to learn. it meets you right where you are. too fucking true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so this was my first journey where i expected to have visuals. and as the medicine was working its way in, i was looking all around the room for them. at candles, at faces, at lights, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after our guide came over and checked in on me, i noticed my heart racing. i had some curiosity about that and thought “well, since i’m not seeing anything, at least i can tune into my body like i do when i meditate.” and i thought that that usually happens easier when my eyes are closed. so i close my eyes to tune in more and then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAM! visuals. shapes floating around and rainbows and shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of course, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the lesson: stop looking outside of yourself for the interesting stuff. it’s all happening inside you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so that’s the process that these particular medicines put me through. they make a way i’m viewing the world VERY literal and then once i see it, i can topple it and move on to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this happens like 50 times over the course of the evening. which is wild!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so, to my earlier thought, if that starts happening faster and faster over time in my life outside of journey space… well, damn. lol.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">so. one thing: i think i am releasing the commitment to adding more to that previous journey post. it’s causing me more weight and angst than i think is necessary. i’ll add more to it if i feel it but i’m not committed to it anymore. i am learning, practicing how to release old commitments.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">journey 1 - breadcrumbs</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/journey/2019/03/16/journey-breadcrumbs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="journey 1 - breadcrumbs" /><published>2019-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/journey/2019/03/16/journey-breadcrumbs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/journey/2019/03/16/journey-breadcrumbs/">&lt;p&gt;so first thing to share: &lt;a href=&quot;http://lqb2.co/blog///2019/03/13/breadcrumbs/&quot;&gt;this post about breadcrumbs on my regular blog&lt;/a&gt; is 100% a journey experience. that is the headline takeaway from this journey: only breadcrumbs can be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that leads to three actions for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find the breadcrumbs of my ancestors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make and eat this lifetime here and now (since i can’t leave it behind)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leave breadcrumbs for my descendants (bio and/or chosen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some other thoughts about the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what is so magical to me about the combination of these particular medicines (let’s call one ‘heart’ and the other ‘forest’) is that they make my worldviews and limiting beliefs LITERAL and then, once i can see them, i usually get the chance to break through them. this happens in regular life too, but so much more slowly. it happens in journeyspace like every few minutes (if not faster).
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;and in some ways, this is exhausting. i know the medicines have physical explanations as to why we feel tired or sore after moving them through our systems, but this rapid worldview shifting feels like the psychic facet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so much can happen while the medicines are in me &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; what happens with those insights is continually expanded afterwards. after sleeping and waking up for integration, the discussion and thoughts from others who were in the space can flip, rotate, explode, or widen what i had previously thought the insight was. and as i have begun to integrate some of the thoughts and insights into my life this past week, i talk to people about them and they take on even more meaning/layers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i wrote a TON during the early chunk of the journey when the medicine was coming on. i have never had the desire to write anything before in ceremony so i’m not sure what changed this time. more forest medicine? the small setting (1 guide, 1 co-journeymate)? the context? who knows…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, here’s a rundown of the breadcrumbs i left myself (know that this is probably 1/3 or less of what happened). things in brackets are descriptions of context. the breadcrumbs are in present tense (they’re only slightly edited version of what i actually wrote):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thought-flow-1&quot;&gt;thought flow 1:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[i started the journey laying down with my frog in my left hand, his stick in my right hand, one of my sweetgrass baskets on my belly and a polaroid of me holding my godson, asa shortly after his birth.] i don’t have visuals! of queer, christian fatherhood. does this mean i’m supposed to be a model of that? not committing to that now but noticing…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oh wait, maybe i do have models of that… they’re called monks. i just don’t want that model. i want more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;but on that tip… what does it look like to give birth to a soul? (note to self: talk to luana about this)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;look into baptism as a practice (also eroc baptized me on cortes island)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i’ve been getting a lot of signals about my throat chakra lately but in this moment i think what’s coming up for me is that the blockage i need to clear isn’t mine… it’s my dad’s! maybe &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; is my closest model of queer christian fatherhood. holy shit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;actually, so maybe the modeling that’s needed is queer, christian, black fatherhood?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;need to have some gentle/hard convos with my dad about all those “friends” of his we used to visit&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;also i think part of my own history of sexual abuse happened while we were visiting “friends” or family and i spent lots of time in my male “cousins” bedrooms playing video games and… why are there gaps in my memory here? this is either just forgetting or sexual trauma. gotta go there someday but not today.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aries&quot;&gt;Aries&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;basic personality &amp;amp; ego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memories, and the emotions attached to them bring information that I never refuse. &lt;strong&gt;Timing is everything and any part of my past that is being recovered right now is worth investigating.&lt;/strong&gt;  Even briefly. &lt;strong&gt;I know not to hang on to what is moving through me, but I also know not to resist the current.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am both the container for my experience and the witness of how it pours forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like water overflowing, I allow my imagination to play with the possibilities of what it looks like to live into, through, and beyond the stories of my life.&lt;/strong&gt; To survive is to defy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I allow to define me is my choice, my point of power, and my right to change when and where I need to. With this new moon I am reminded to take note of what I am calling myself, how I am referring to myself, and what that infers to myself. I am here for my liberation, and &lt;em&gt;anything that needs to be released on the way to my personal freedom must be given back to its owner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within the incubators that house my creative energy I give myself permission to regenerate. Here I reclaim myself, rename myself if need be, and remember that I am always becoming&lt;/strong&gt;, undefined by what has happened to me or hasn’t happened for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aquarius-rising&quot;&gt;Aquarius Rising&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how others experience me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is mine to work with has always been and will always be.  I need not fight it, push it, or feel like someone else can take it from me. My resources may take their own time to develop, but they deserve every second they need to take shape. I trust that when the tide ebbs it will flow again. I trust that the projects that wash up on shore are gifts for me to develop. I know that anything that gets lost at sea need not concern me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am here to work on what is in front of me.&lt;/strong&gt; No fantasy. Just the reality of working towards my dreams with every solid, grounded,  effort I can make. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I no longer place my talent, time, and resources into containers too leaky to hold them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Ideas without action aren’t failures, they are foolish to focus on. If I want it, I work towards it. Inwardly and outwardly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m healing my relationship to my financial life no matter the damage, drain, or despair that I’ve experienced because of it. I am not at the whim of my livelihood, but the curator in relationship with it and all it might be able to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;virgo&quot;&gt;Virgo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;moon: inner self &amp;amp; deepest emotions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am made stronger by every moment of vulnerability I have allowed myself.&lt;/strong&gt; Even when I’m met with less warmth than I’d hoped from others, I’m still fortified by my own efforts. &lt;strong&gt;Being honest in front of others takes courage.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I am willing to look like a human who makes both mistakes and as many attempts to get it right as it requires. I am willing to be humbled by all that I still need to learn.&lt;/strong&gt; I am willing to be misunderstood on the way to being known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in no rush to be right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My relationships require me to learn how to be open to my own experience when I’d rather shut down, shut you out, or shut the door completely. &lt;em&gt;When I am able to hang out in the moments of wanting to do so, without actually doing so, I know that growth is occurring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I know that change is possible. I know that from this place all the information I need becomes available to me. &lt;strong&gt;With much change on the horizon, I know that developing the skills to sit with what’s uncertain and uncomfortable is more than useful, it’s the most reliable compass I’ll ever have contact with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chiron description from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cafeastrology.com/chiron.html&quot;&gt;cafe astrology&lt;/a&gt;. shout out to luana for suggesting i look up where chiron is in my chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chiron is a comet with a unique and erratic orbit. In the natal chart, Chiron is symbolized by the “wounded healer”. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Chiron in Astrology: Chiron in our natal charts points to where we have healing powers as the result of our own deep spiritual wounds. We may over-compensate in these areas of life. Chiron, as a wounded healer, first must face issues of low self-worth and feelings of inadequacy and learn to rise above these issues. Because the wound goes deep, and we may work hard to overcome the wound, healing powers are potent.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I honor the editing process that I am in. Like weeding an overgrown garden, I remove what is unhelpful in order to bring out the beauty naturally present.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I work with this new moon to clear what clutters my path.&lt;/strong&gt; Doubts that have no sense need to be dumped. Fears that have no foundation need to be exposed as the frauds that they are.  &lt;strong&gt;Shame that no longer serves a purpose needs to be shown the door. This clearing is mine to do. It can’t be shopped out, left for another, or put off.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This helps me take responsibility for the direction I am heading in, but it also helps me feel empowered in the process of doing so. The more I own my desire to head in the direction of my dreams, the less likely I am to resent the work necessary to get there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this new moon I claim the path that I am on&lt;/strong&gt;, all that it asks of me, and all that it asks me to give up, miss out on, or forgo for it. I am crystal clear about the price and that the payoff is to merely be in this process with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I use this Mercury retrograde to review my strategies, maps, and ways of getting from point A to B, making sure that they leave me open to get all the way to Z.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-pisces-march-2019/</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">tarot synchronicity as i prepare for journey work</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/03/04/tarot-synchronicity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="tarot synchronicity as i prepare for journey work" /><published>2019-03-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/03/04/tarot-synchronicity</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/general/2019/03/04/tarot-synchronicity/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hcUTLxs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Mysticism and revolution are two aspects of the same attempt to bring about radical change. Mystics cannot prevent themselves from becoming social critics, since in self-reflection they will discover the roots of a sick society. Similarly, revolutionaries cannot avoid facing their own human condition, since in the midst of their struggle for a new world they will find that they are also fighting their own reactionary fears and false ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When we wonder why the language of tradition Christianity has lost its liberation power for nuclear man, we have to realize that most Christian preaching is still based on the presupposition that man sees himself as meaningfully integrated with a history in which God came to us in the past, is living under us in the present, and will come to liberate us in the future. But when man’s historical consciousness is broken, the whole Christian message seems like a lecture about the great pioneers to a boy on an acid trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and the next paragraph of the above quote)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But how can we avoid this danger? I think by no other way than to enter ourselves first of all into the center of our existence and become familiar with the complexities of our inner lives. As soon as we feel at home in our own house, discover the dark corners as well as the light spots, the closed doors as well as the drafty roos, our confusion will evaporate, our anxiety will diminish, and we will become capable of creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i love that one because it’s my new definition and purpose for doing shadow work (which i’ve been talking to some of yall about). i’m adding these words to words already in my mind/heart that two of yall have shared with me. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But just as bread given without love can bring war instead of peace, professionalism without compassion will turn forgiveness into a gimmick, and the kingdon to come into a blindfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the other day i was sitting in the barbershop texting kendra. we were talking about scheduling a phone call and i was being all sorts of weird about it. i realized this in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she asked me for some dates that worked during a particular week. i responded with a message about being out of town for three days that week. then the below conversation ensued…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aZoqaud.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i worked through my own stuff, kendra saw that last message from me and then said something that literally rocked my world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JMHgjkZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i teared up right then and there in the barbershop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i didn’t realize how tightly i hold onto my fear of disappointing other people!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;kendra and i texted some more and she said (paraphrased) “given what you said, i could feel that you needed to hear that from me. don’t ever worry about disappointing me, and especially not when you’re taking space to do what you need to do for yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ho. lee. shit. i am leveled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gonna be sitting with this for some days/weeks/months. how many situations in my life are shaped by this belief of mine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i will shift it in time, but for now, just noticing and reflecting… wow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">story.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Horoscopes for the New Moon in Aquarius – February 2019</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/02/17/new-moon-in-aquarius/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Horoscopes for the New Moon in Aquarius – February 2019" /><published>2019-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/02/17/new-moon-in-aquarius</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/horoscope/2019/02/17/new-moon-in-aquarius/">&lt;p&gt;source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-aquarius-2019-horoscopes/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aries&quot;&gt;Aries&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;basic personality &amp;amp; ego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aligning myself with the people, places, and actions that bring me closer to my dreams is my main priority. There are a million distractions, doubts, and fears to get caught up in daily.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a million ways in which I have been taught to devalue my vision, to denigrate it, to convince myself that I am not the answer to it as much as it is to me. &lt;strong&gt;But my destiny is to be met on a two-way street.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It needs me to make room for it every day. Aligning myself with what I most want to manifest is something I have to consciously do. Repeatedly. Daily.&lt;/strong&gt; Enthusiastically if possible. Honestly, always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am being truthful, &lt;strong&gt;when unchecked I will tend to grasp for what might make my ego momentarily happy&lt;/strong&gt;. A place. A thing. A person. An idea of success, love, or acceptance. But &lt;strong&gt;unless achieved in a way that deepens my connection to myself, my loves, my life, and my world, nothing will satisfy my soul’s desire to do good work with good people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to know what it means to feel aligned with my life’s purpose&lt;/strong&gt; so deeply that I never refuse the challenges, victories and defeats along the way. &lt;strong&gt;I don’t waste my time chasing fool’s gold.&lt;/strong&gt; I want the glimmer to be inner, first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aquarius-rising&quot;&gt;Aquarius Rising&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how others experience me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am renewed each time I allow myself to move thoroughly through a process. Each time I allow myself to reach the bottom, to ground, to land. Bouncing back is not necessarily the end-game, but unless I get to the bottom of things, I’ll never be able to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each time I allow myself to look up.&lt;/strong&gt; Stretch up. Rise up towards the light. &lt;strong&gt;I am refusing to stay in the shadows of my past.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Each time I allow myself the luxury of cycling through my process without feeling rushed or overly attached to any one part of it, my energy is regenerated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am renewed each time I remember that life is not something I figure out, but something I find a way to be in partnership with.&lt;/strong&gt; Each time I try to pin my possibilities down into a definite answer, I am deadening the energy of everything else that is trying to flow towards me. &lt;strong&gt;With this new moon I release the need to know how, what, where, or with whom things will work out&lt;/strong&gt; and instead I focus on the direction I feel pulled towards in this moment. &lt;strong&gt;Every time I gather my energy, recalling it from the past, I am reinvesting in myself, this moment, and all the possibility it possesses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;virgo&quot;&gt;Virgo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;moon: inner self &amp;amp; deepest emotions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I find every avenue possible to love the labor.&lt;/strong&gt; As much as I take advantage of rest. As much as I honor my downtime. As much as I revel in my free-time, to the best of my ability I find things to adore about my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I want bounty to come from my efforts, I have to make peace with the practice that goes into creating it. &lt;strong&gt;The secret to my success is loving the process&lt;/strong&gt;, not just the performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave room for opportunity. &lt;strong&gt;I remember not to get too rigid in how I think my work or efforts will be received, what they will amount to, or where they will go.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I work in ways that help to regenerate my creative energy.&lt;/strong&gt; I work in ways that keep me focus on the reasons that I do what I do. &lt;strong&gt;To the best of my ability, I clear out what leaves me feeling cluttered, muddled, or confused about my direction.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am here to work towards what will bring the most joy and healing to the most people, places, and causes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">source: https://chaninicholas.com/new-moon-aquarius-2019-horoscopes/</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a walk in the arboretum</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/02/17/known-and-unknown/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a walk in the arboretum" /><published>2019-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/02/17/known-and-unknown</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/formation/insight/2019/02/17/known-and-unknown/">&lt;p&gt;this write up is more brief than the weight it carries, but i’ve been trying to write it for three days and not doing it because i’m overblowing the time it needs in my mind. working on moving through that by sharing here in short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last week i committed to a bringing a new spiritual practice into my regular ritual flows. i guess it’s actually just a modification, but i’m going to shift my usual saturday 1h sitting meditation into a Spirit walk. ideally it’ll be through the arnold arboretum, but wherever i can find some nature will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today, i went on my first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was prompted because i was going to be hosting full moon circle later and the last time i held one, i did 1h in the arb and it felt like what was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so today i walked in my usual gate and felt drawn to a path i’ve often looked at but had never taken before. as i walked, i reveled in getting to know the new territory. and soon enough, i found myself near the shrub and vine collect where the bonsai collection is (learning: the bonsai collection is only available outdoors april - nov)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i stumbled onto that familar place i was reminded that i love that sensation! the feel of finding my way to a place i know but from a totally new angle. i love love love when this happens in cities! often when i’m new to a city i’ll see lots of it for starters and then i’ll settle into areas near where i live and get to know those areas really well. then, as i start to expand and explore again, i’ll find myself back to places i visited early on but didn’t realize how they connected to my usual pathways. it’s the “omg THAT’S where this road goes” moment. i literally love those moments…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then it dawned on me: that’s what deep internal work looks and feels like. the work of self-exploration and also integration is just the process of exploring the unknown paths between known areas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;phew. maybe that was a lot more intense in my head or for me than it is for you, but it feels like a major breakthrough for me! :D&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">this write up is more brief than the weight it carries, but i’ve been trying to write it for three days and not doing it because i’m overblowing the time it needs in my mind. working on moving through that by sharing here in short:</summary></entry></feed>
